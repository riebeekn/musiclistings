                  <h2>Pigs Pigs Pigs Pigs Pigs Pigs Pigs </h2>
                  <h4>w/ Rickshaw Billie's Burger Patrol, Tumble</h4>
                  <p>
                  <p><strong>Pigs Pigs Pigs Pigs Pigs Pigs Pigs</strong> (aka <strong>Pigs x7</strong>) are a Newcastle-born quintet forging a reputation as one of the UK’s most ferocious heavy acts. Formed in 2012, this psychedelic stoner-metal outfit marries crushing riffs with hypnotic repetition and noise-rock chaos. They never imagined reaching a fifth album – in early days they barely made it out of the pub – yet their 2017 debut, <em>Feed the Rats</em>, kicked off an extraordinary ascent. That three-track “monsterpiece” of fuzzed-out doom was followed by 2018’s rollicking, <em>King of Cowards</em>, 2020’s shape-shifting, <em>Viscerals</em>, and 2023’s anthemic, <em>Land of Sleeper</em>. Each release expanded their smorgasbord of heavy styles, from Sabbath-like sludge to Motörhead-paced mayhem, all delivered with theatrical intensity and a sly grin.</p>
                  <p>Now, <strong>Pigs x7</strong> unleash, <em>Death Hilarious (2025)</em>, their most directly hostile opus yet. Written after relentless touring, the album bottles the reckless catharsis of their live shows – a “slap in the face” of angular aggression and adrenaline. Frontman Matt Baty’s vocals channel paradoxical emotions, grappling with anxiety and absurdity amidst the swagger of heavy music. Producer/guitarist Sam Grant ensures everything hits with well-oiled precision and scalding rawness. <em>Death Hilarious</em> shape-shifts through “diversely punishing” extremes – from Sabbathian doom to minimalist noise-rock and cyclical post-metal climaxes. Surprise touches like eerie synths and piano lurk beneath the chaos, and a guest verse from rap icon <strong>El-P</strong> (<strong>Run The Jewels</strong>) on “Glib Tongued” highlights the band’s adventurous spirit. Yet amidst the darkness, <strong>Pigs x7</strong> revel in contrasts: they wield dark, aggressive music with uplifting, campy flair, always “grounded by the ridiculous band name” that started as a drunken joke. With <em>Death Hilarious</em>, <strong>Pigs x7</strong> affirm their status as “doom metal mavericks… [and] a taut, well-honed machine that doesn’t fuck around” – an unstoppable force at the cutting edge of heavy music.</p>

                  <p>
                  <p><strong>Joeboy</strong> is a Nigerian singer-songwriter whose music embodies the vibrant fusion of Afropop and R&amp;B. Bursting onto the scene in 2019 with addictive love anthems, he quickly became known for catchy melodies and emotive lyrics that capture the innocence of young love and the sting of heartbreak. His smooth vocals—often delivered in a signature airy falsetto over fluid Afropop beats—set him apart as a leading voice in the new wave of Nigerian pop.</p>
                  <p>Over the years, <strong>Joeboy’s</strong> sound has evolved beyond upbeat romance. He began infusing more <em>R&amp;B soul</em> into his songwriting, layering heartfelt harmonies and mellow grooves into his repertoire. “Deep inside, artistically… I lean towards R&amp;B,” Joeboy has admitted, a foundation that grounds the warmth and intimacy in his music. At the same time, he’s never been afraid to experiment: Joeboy continually pushes Afropop’s boundaries, blending in <em>global influences</em> and sonic surprises. On recent projects, he breaks away from standard Afropop conventions—incorporating elements like highlife, Middle Eastern strings, and South African log drums—yet maintains an infectious, accessible style.</p>
                  <p>The result is a dynamic musical catalog that swings from dance-floor hits to reflective ballads, all unified by his melodic voice and relatable songwriting. <strong>Joeboy’s</strong> artistic journey showcases a remarkable growth in creativity and versatility, solidifying his status as an Afrobeats trailblazer with a <em>distinctive signature sound</em>.</p>

                  <p>
                  <p>Toronto’s <strong>PUP</strong> has firmly established themselves as one of the most explosive, high-energy punk bands of their generation. Formed in 2010, the quartet—comprised of <strong>Stefan Babcock</strong> (vocals, guitar), <strong>Steve Sladkowski</strong> (guitar), <strong>Nestor Chumak</strong> (bass), and <strong>Zack Mykula</strong> (drums)—quickly gained acclaim for their relentless live performances, razor-sharp wit, and raw emotional honesty. Blending catchy hooks with frenetic instrumentation, their sound draws from classic punk, indie rock, and hardcore, resulting in a uniquely engaging sonic experience.</p>
                  <p>Their breakthrough album, <em>The Dream Is Over (2016)</em>, captured global attention with anthems of anxiety, resilience, and dark humor, earning widespread praise from critics and a dedicated fanbase. The follow-up, 2019’s, <em>Morbid Stuff</em>, cemented their reputation further, showcasing the band&#8217;s skillful songwriting through heartfelt, punchy tracks like “Kids” and “Scorpion Hill.”</p>
                  <p>PUP’s relentless touring has built an international following, with chaotic yet cathartic live shows that have become legendary among fans. Their latest album, <em>THE UNRAVELING OF PUPTHEBAND (2022)</em>, continues to push boundaries, exploring themes of self-destruction, uncertainty, and absurdity with fearless honesty and biting self-awareness.</p>
                  <p>Celebrated for their DIY spirit and authentic approach, <strong>PUP</strong> has received accolades from <strong>JUNO Awards</strong> to <strong>Polaris Music Prize</strong> nominations. With a growing legacy built on genuine storytelling, explosive energy, and unmatched stage presence, <strong>PUP</strong> stands out as an essential force in contemporary punk rock—defiant, insightful, and impossible to ignore.</p>

                  <h2>Cymande </h2>
                  <p>
                  <p><strong>Cymande</strong> (pronounced <em>Sah-mahn-day</em>) are the legendary Black British funk, soul, and reggae trailblazers whose groove shook the 1970s—and who are back today with more fire than ever. Formed in early ’70s London by childhood immigrants from Guyana, Jamaica, and St. Vincent, Cymande fused their Caribbean roots with funk, jazz, R&amp;B, and Afro-rock into a genre-defying sound they cheekily dubbed <strong>“Nyah-Rock.”</strong> Their first run of albums—<em>Cymande</em> (1972), <em>Second Time Round</em> (1973), and <em>Promised Heights</em> (1974)—became instant cult classics, mixing socially conscious lyrics and Rastafarian rhythms with hypnotic basslines and jazzy improvisations. Cymande made history as the first British band to play Harlem’s Apollo Theater, toured with Al Green, and cracked U.S. charts simultaneously. Yet, at home, a <em>“total lack of interest”</em> from the UK music industry led to their disheartened hiatus in 1975—a break lasting nearly 40 years.</p>
                  <p>Their songs lived on, sampled heavily by hip-hop legends like <strong>De La Soul, The Fugees, Wu-Tang Clan,</strong> and <strong>Gang Starr</strong>, cementing Cymande’s status as influential pioneers whose legacy outstripped their fame. Their resurgence, fueled by the acclaimed documentary <em>Getting It Back: The Story of Cymande</em> (2022), set the stage for their triumphant new album, <strong><em>Renascence</em> (2025)</strong>. Channeling classic mellow funk and spirituality into modern grooves—like <em>“Chasing an Empty Dream”</em> and <em>“How We Roll”</em> featuring <strong>Jazzie B</strong>—Cymande’s live shows now bring together generations in joyful unity. Their remarkable renaissance proves the timeless power of peace, love, and funkiness.</p>

                  <h4>w/ Special Guests</h4>
                  <p>
                  <p><strong>IAM</strong> stands as a pillar of French hip-hop, a group whose journey embodies the evolution of the genre. Formed in 1989 in Marseille, IAM blends hard-hitting boom-bap beats with global influences, famously infusing ancient Egyptian and Asian imagery into their music. The crew – Akhenaton, Shurik’n, Khéops, Imhotep, and Kephren – quickly earned a reputation for conscious lyrics and innovative production. <em>…De la planète Mars</em> (1991) and <em>Ombre est Lumière</em> (1993) laid the groundwork, but it was 1997’s <em>L’École du micro d’argent</em> that cemented IAM’s iconic status with its raw storytelling and East-West fusion. </p>
                  <blockquote>
                     <p>“IAM’s music is a bridge between Marseille’s streets and the world’s ears.”</p>
                  </blockquote>
                  <p> Over the decades, IAM’s signature style – poetic social commentary over cinematic soundscapes – has remained intact even as their sound evolved. The 2003 album <em>Revoir un printemps</em> introduced soulful melodies and international collaborations, while 2007’s <em>Saison 5</em> showcased mature reflections and classic funk vibes. After a brief hiatus, IAM made a triumphant return with the back-to-back albums <em>Arts Martiens</em> and <em>… IAM</em> in 2013, proving their timeless relevance. They continued to push boundaries on 2017’s <em>Rêvolution</em> and 2019’s <em>Yasuke</em>, delivering modern production layered with the group’s trademark wisdom and fire. From their early anthems like “La Saga” to recent powerful tracks, IAM has never lost its edge. This is music with a message – socially conscious, fiercely proud of its roots, and ever-evolving. Three decades on, IAM’s legacy grows stronger, inspiring generations of fans with their uncompromising artistry and authentic voice in French rap.</p>

                  <h2>clipping. </h2>
                  <h4>w/ Counterfeit Madison</h4>
                  <p>
                  <p>Los Angeles trio <strong>clipping.</strong> (<strong>Daveed Diggs</strong>, <strong>William Hutson</strong>, <strong>Jonathan Snipes</strong>) have spent the last decade ripping up the rules of hip-hop and reassembling them in glorious noise. Formed in 2009 as an experimental remix project, they debuted with the self-released midcity (2013), a caustic cocktail of power electronics and rap that unexpectedly caught fire and landed them a deal with Sub Pop Records​. Their 2014 label debut, <em>CLPPNG</em>, announced clipping.’s arrival with ferocious intent – “party music for the club you wish you hadn’t gone to” as the band quipped – omitting the word “I” from its lyrics to obliterate hip-hop’s ego and make room for pure sonic experimentation. Each subsequent release has pushed new frontiers: 2016’s, <em>Splendor &amp; Misery</em>, was an Afrofuturist space odyssey that earned the group <strong>Hugo Award</strong> nominations for its sci-fi narrative​, while 2019’s, <em>There Existed an Addiction to Blood</em>, and 2020’s, <em>Visions of Bodies Being Burned</em>, formed a blood-soaked horrorcore opus. Throughout, <strong>clipping.</strong> have balanced blistering, industrial noise textures with Diggs’s rapid-fire, precise flow – a sound once described as “shrill thrills… twisting industrial metal into brutal new shapes, with rapping on top”. Now, on 2025’s, <em>Dead Channel Sky</em>, <strong>clipping.</strong> turn their gaze to cyberpunk dystopia. Diggs spits with mechanical precision over warped techno and breakbeats, conjuring a “noirish cyberpunk world of hackers, clubgoers, future-soldiers and digital avatars”​. Intense, abrasive, yet eerily accessible, <em>Dead Channel Sky</em>, is the culmination of clipping.’s avant-garde journey – a bold testament to their status as one of hip-hop’s most visionary and uncompromising acts.</p>

                  <p>
                  <p><strong>Do Make Say Think</strong> is a Canadian post-rock collective hailed for their expansive soundscapes and intricate, experimental compositions. Emerging from Toronto’s fertile indie scene in the mid-1990s, the band quickly carved out a distinctive niche: atmospheric instrumentals interwoven with subtle jazz, dub, and psychedelic influences. Over the years, <strong>Do Make Say Think</strong> have developed a signature style of layering guitars, horns, and orchestral arrangements over meticulously crafted rhythms. Their music often evolves gradually—swelling from gentle melodic passages to grand crescendos—yet they avoid formulaic loud-soft patterns that characterize much of post-rock.</p>
                  <p>From their self-titled debut’s warm lo-fi textures to the more refined sonic tapestries on albums like <em>Other Truths</em> and <em>Stubborn Persistent Illusions</em>, Do Make Say Think’s trajectory shows a commitment to constant reinvention. Their penchant for multi-part epics, understated vocal samples, and subtle studio experimentation has led critics to describe them as “post-rock at its most fluid and free,” defying neat genre boundaries. The band’s members—Ohad Benchetrit, Justin Small, Charles Spearin, Dave Mitchell, and James Payment—often collaborate on side projects, further enriching the group’s unpredictable palette of sounds.</p>
                  <p>Despite employing few traditional vocals, Do Make Say Think’s music feels deeply emotional, inviting listeners on immersive journeys that blur the lines between rock, ambient, and experimental jazz. Instrumental passages become communal crescendos, a hallmark of their live shows as well. Sprawling yet cohesive, <strong>Do Make Say Think</strong> continue to craft thoughtful, cinematic compositions that captivate fans of forward-thinking post-rock all over the globe.</p>

                  <h2>Propagandhi</h2>
                  <h3>Canadian Tour 2025</h3>
                  <p>
                  <p><strong>Propagandhi</strong>, formed in Manitoba, Canada, stands as one of punk rock’s most relentlessly innovative bands. Emerging as skate-thrash provocateurs with their 1993 debut, <em>How to Clean Everything</em>, their early sound fused rebellious punk vigor with biting satire. Over three decades, <strong>Propagandhi</strong> has meticulously reshaped their musical identity, continuously pushing boundaries by blending hardcore intensity, intricate technical metal, and razor-sharp lyrical insight into their own genre-defying style.</p>
                  <p>Their sonic evolution accelerated in the late ‘90s with albums like <em>Less Talk, More Rock</em>, openly challenging punk’s musical conservatism. Never settling, the band progressively embraced complexity, layering thrash-metal influences reminiscent of <em>Kreator</em>, <em>Voivod</em>, and <em>Celtic Frost</em> atop punk foundations. This musical trajectory culminated in groundbreaking releases like <em>Supporting Caste</em> and <em>Failed States</em>, where virtuosic instrumentation, unconventional song structures, and dense melodic arrangements redefined their musical identity.</p>
                  <p>Their eighth album, <em>At Peace</em>, represents yet another bold step forward, capturing both existential reflection and uncompromising aggression. Guitarist-vocalist <strong>Chris Hannah</strong>’s thoughtful songwriting, drummer <strong>Jord Samolesky</strong>’s relentless rhythms, bassist <strong>Todd Kowalski</strong>’s muscular interplay, and guitarist <strong>Sulynn Hago</strong>’s textured leads coalesce into songs balancing despair, dark humor, and stark social commentary. Produced with blistering clarity by <strong>Jason Livermore</strong> (<em>Rise Against</em>, <em>Hot Water Music</em>), the album showcases a band unafraid to experiment sonically, confronting complex truths through poetic fury and technical mastery.</p>
                  <p>After decades of relentless experimentation, <strong>Propagandhi</strong> remains defiantly original, crafting <em>“smart music for dangerous times”</em> with equal parts introspection, intensity, and sonic innovation.</p>

                  <h2>CMAT </h2>
                  <h3>It's the Euro-Country Tour!</h3>
                  <p>
                  <p>Ciara Mary-Alice Thompson – better known as <strong>CMAT</strong> – is the fiery Irish alt-pop/country diva turning heartache into high drama. With tongue-in-cheek flair and a Dolly-esque knack for storytelling, CMAT’s music marries <em>vintage country balladry with glam-pop sparkle</em>, inviting listeners to laugh through tears. Her debut album, <strong><em>If My Wife New I’d Be Dead</em> (2022)</strong>, shot to No.1 in Ireland, winning hearts (and the Choice Music Prize) with songs that are <em>“mournful yet accessible…cleverly crafted, but crucially, with a huge sense of humour.”</em> On stage, she’s equal parts comedian and cathartic crooner – belting breakup anthems in sequins and cowboy boots, and winking through the pain.</p>
                  <p>After viral singles like <strong>“I Wanna Be a Cowboy, Baby!”</strong> and playful tirades such as <strong>“No More Virgos,”</strong> CMAT doubled down on her outrageous authenticity with <strong><em>Crazymad, for Me</em> (2023)</strong>. This “abstract break-up album” is an ambitious time-traveling romp that cemented her as a creator of <em>“bone-achingly funny pop.”</em> Whether crooning about climate change in the seductively campy <strong>“Mayday”</strong> or duetting with John Grant on the swooning <strong>“Where Are Your Kids Tonight?”</strong>, CMAT delivers <em>big emotions and bigger choruses.</em> Unapologetically herself, she transforms personal chaos into communal theater, rallying her <em>“staunchly devoted fans”</em> who adore her as much for her self-deprecating wit as her jaw-dropping vocal twang. In a world that often feels heavy, CMAT is the flamboyant, sharp-tongued songstress reminding us to find <strong>humor in heartbreak and glamour in the gloom.</strong></p>

                  <p><strong>Lankum</strong> are a Dublin four-piece breathing new, defiant life into Irish folk music. With roots in street ballads and traditional tunes, they infuse these foundations with droning harmoniums, uilleann pipes, and sumptuous four-part vocal harmonies. The result is a dark, hypnotic sound that marries the raw storytelling of folk with the atmospheric intensity of drone and punk. Fans of experimental folk are drawn to Lankum’s eerie, immersive arrangements – as <em>The Guardian</em> noted, their songs evoke <em>Portishead’s witchy ambience</em> and even the textured heaviness of <em>Sunn O)))</em>, yet remain deeply rooted in Irish tradition.</p>
                  <p>Over four studio albums and a new live record, Lankum have pushed folk music’s boundaries. They transform well-known ballads with <em>“extreme makeovers,”</em> uncovering gritty historical undercurrents and contemporary resonances. From the mournful drones of <strong><em>The Livelong Day</em></strong> (2019) to the epic soundscapes of their Mercury Prize–nominated <strong><em>False Lankum</em></strong> (2023), each release showcases the band’s political consciousness and emotional depth. Their original songs address themes like urban alienation and generational trauma with unflinching poetry and passion.</p>
                  <p>Critics and peers have lauded Lankum’s innovative spirit. They won Ireland’s RTÉ Choice Music Prize for Album of the Year in 2019, and their visceral live performances – captured on <strong><em>Live in Dublin</em></strong> (2024) – are often described as euphoric and transformative. For followers of dark, experimental folk, Lankum have become standard-bearers, carrying the Irish folk songbook into new realms of intensity and atmosphere while honoring its rebellious soul.</p>

                  <h2>Deltron 3030 </h2>
                  <h4>w/ Kid Koala x Lealani</h4>
                  <p>
                  <p><strong>Deltron 3030</strong> is the visionary hip-hop collective comprised of lyricist <strong>Del the Funky Homosapien</strong> (a.k.a. Deltron Zero), producer <strong>Dan the Automator</strong> (The Cantankerous Captain Aptos), and turntablist <strong>Kid Koala</strong> (Skiznod the Boy Wonder). Formed in 1999, the trio debuted at the turn of the millennium with a groundbreaking concept album set in the year 3030, fusing dense lyrical storytelling, cinematic production, and turntable wizardry to create one of the most iconic and influential sci-fi hip-hop projects of all time.<br />
                     Their debut album, <em>Deltron 3030 (2000)</em>, instantly became a cult classic, praised for its imaginative dystopian themes and social commentary. It positioned the group as pioneers in conceptual hip-hop and inspired countless artists to explore more narrative-driven, genre-blending approaches. Del’s cerebral verses, Dan’s lush, symphonic beats, and Koala’s experimental scratching blended into a soundscape unlike anything else in hip-hop at the time.<br />
                     Individually, each member brought a pedigree of innovation to the table. Del first gained recognition through his cousin <strong>Ice Cube</strong>, later forming the Hieroglyphics crew and collaborating with <strong>Gorillaz</strong> on breakout hits like “Clint Eastwood.” <strong>Dan the Automator</strong> earned acclaim for producing <strong>Dr. Octagon</strong> with <strong>Kool Keith</strong> and went on to produce Gorillaz’s debut album. <strong>Kid Koala</strong>, signed to <strong>Ninja Tune</strong>, became internationally known for pushing the boundaries of turntablism and live performance.<br />
                     Their follow-up album, <em>Event 2</em>, arrived in 2013 after more than a decade of anticipation, expanding their sonic palette with live instrumentation and deeper explorations of societal decay and resistance in the year 3030. The group has also performed select live shows with orchestras, further highlighting the cinematic ambition of their work.<br />
                     Though their releases are few, Deltron 3030’s impact is enduring. The group continues to maintain a passionate global fanbase and remains a benchmark for innovation in hip-hop. With a third album in development and recent performances alongside <strong>Wu-Tang Clan</strong> and <strong>Run the Jewels</strong>, Deltron 3030’s saga is far from over—offering a timeless soundtrack for anyone questioning the future.

                  <h4>w/ Cold Hart</h4>
                  <p>
                  <p><strong>Lil Tracy</strong> (<strong>Jazz Ishmael Butler</strong>) is an emo-rap trailblazer known for blending heart-on-sleeve lyrics with trap beats and punk energy. Rising from the SoundCloud rap scene, Tracy first gained notoriety through emotional collaborations with the late <strong>Lil Peep</strong> – their song “Awful Things” hit the <strong>Billboard Hot 100</strong>. Embracing an underground ethos, he became a leading voice of Gen Z’s goth-rap movement, channeling angst and melody in equal measure. As a member of the <strong>GothBoiClique</strong> collective alongside artists like <strong>Cold Hart</strong> and <strong>Fish Narc</strong>, Tracy helped popularize the “emo-trap” sound that resonates with a generation of outcasts and romantics. Tracy’s style is moody yet infectious: he flips from dark, vampiric aesthetics to playful pop culture nods, keeping fans hooked on his unpredictable persona. The son of musician parents (<strong>Ishmael Butler</strong> of <strong>Digable Planets</strong> and R&amp;B singer <strong>Coko</strong>), he forged his own identity through alter-egos like “Tracy Minaj” and a fearless DIY approach. His discography spans hazy mixtapes and full-length projects like, <em>Anarchy (2019)</em>, and, <em>Designer Talk 2 (2020)</em>, showcasing growth from raw <strong>SoundCloud</strong> cuts to polished anthems. With over 1 million Instagram followers tuning in to his every move, <strong>Lil Tracy</strong> maintains an ardent cult following. His latest album, <em>Babyvamp (2025)</em>, pushes his vampiric-emo vibe further, proving that <strong>Lil Tracy</strong> continues to evolve while staying true to the emotive, rebellious spirit that makes him so relatable to his fans.</p>

                  <h2>Sacrifice </h2>
                  <p>
                  <p><strong>Sacrifice</strong> is a Canadian thrash metal band renowned for their relentless speed and evolving songwriting. Bursting out of Toronto’s underground in the mid-1980s, <strong>Sacrifice</strong> quickly earned a reputation for <em>intense, crunchy, Slayer-esque thrash</em> on early albums like <em>Torment in Fire</em> (1986). Their formative sound combined raw aggression with punk influences, yielding a primitive but powerful style that helped define Canadian thrash.</p>
                  <p>As the band progressed through <em>Forward to Termination</em> (1987) and <em>Soldiers of Misfortune</em> (1990), Sacrifice’s music grew more sophisticated without losing its ferocity. Pummeling riffs, whiplash tempo changes, and Rob Urbinati’s caustic vocals remained their signature, even as mid-tempo sections and intricate twin-guitar leads added depth to the chaos. This balance of <em>boiling aggression and depth of songwriting</em> became a hallmark.</p>
                  <p>After a hiatus in the late ’90s, Sacrifice’s 2009 comeback <em>The Ones I Condemn</em> proved the band still delivered <em>pure straight thrash metal</em> true to their roots. In 2025 they unleashed <em>Volume Six</em>, showcasing their original lineup firing on all cylinders. The latest songs run the gamut from speedy, breakneck thrash to more nuanced, layered compositions, even touching on atmospheric and psychedelic extremes—all while staying unmistakably Sacrifice. Widely hailed as one of Canada’s <em>“Big Four”</em> thrash bands, Sacrifice has continually evolved their razor-sharp sound. Decades into their career, they still deliver a fierce, authentic thrash metal attack driven by scorching riffs and uncompromising intensity.</p>

                  <p>
                  <p><strong>LEISURE</strong> is a New Zealand collective known for their <strong>genre-blending evolution</strong> and laid-back ethos. Formed in 2015 during a spontaneous beach getaway, the six members—producers and songwriters from acts like Kids of 88 and Goodnight Nurse—set out to make music on their own terms. The result is a <strong>signature sound</strong> fusing <em>indie</em> and <em>psychedelic pop</em> with sensual <em>R&amp;B/soul</em> grooves and funk.</p>
                  <p>From their self-titled 2016 debut to 2023’s <em>Leisurevision</em>, LEISURE’s catalog showcases a freeform exploration into pop psychedelia, smooth R&amp;B, and modern soul. Early hits like <em>“Got It Bad”</em> introduced shimmering, laid-back funk vibes, while their sophomore album <em>Twister</em> injected danceable energy and a slick blend of R&amp;B, disco, and psych rock. In 2020, the band embarked on an EP series (<em>Side A</em> and <em>Side B</em>), writing in a French countryside retreat to refresh their inspiration. These tracks—steeped in ‘70s funk, ‘90s boom-bap, and soulful harmonies—were later compiled into the album <em>Sunsetter</em>.</p>
                  <p>Throughout their journey, LEISURE has remained focused on <em>vibe and feel</em> over formulas: lush melodies, groovy basslines, and dreamy vocals create an <strong>unusual melting pot</strong> of funk, hip-hop, R&amp;B, and lush pop. Critics praise the group’s fundamental elements of groove, melody, and atmosphere, hailing LEISURE as a <strong>psychedelic pop</strong> outfit making waves globally.</p>
                  <p>Four albums in, LEISURE continues to evolve—<strong>blending genres</strong> into a warm, escapist sound that invites you to kick back and enjoy the ride <em>at your leisure</em>. Their unhurried approach and eclectic style have become the band’s calling card, proving that taking the scenic route can yield golden results.</p>

                  <h3>Portal North America Tour</h3>
                  <h4>w/ Special Guests</h4>
                  <p>
                  <p><strong>Balu Brigada</strong> is a charismatic alt-pop duo of New Zealand brothers <strong>Henry and Pierre Beasley</strong>, known for their genre-blending musical evolution and signature style that fuses <strong>indie-pop hooks</strong>, <em>synth-driven production</em>, and hip-hop-influenced grooves. The pair cut their teeth jamming in their family home, steadily honing songwriting and production chops since their teens. Early releases, including their 2019, <em>Almost Feel Good</em>, mixtape, showcased a carefree mix of funk-tinged pop and laid-back beats. With each project, <strong>Balu Brigada</strong> have refined their sound, moving from breezy bedroom-pop beginnings to a polished, groove-pop identity. Their 2022 EP, <em>I Should Be Home</em>, and 2023 EP, <em>Find a Way</em>, expanded the duo’s sonic palette – think shimmering synth lines, R&amp;B textures, and playful rap-style rhythms – while retaining their “ultimate chiller” vibe inspired by Baloo from The Jungle Book. Today, Balu Brigada’s music radiates “effortless, laidback cool,” equally fit for coastal road trips or flirty dance floors. Citing genre-mashing heroes like <strong>Gorillaz</strong>, <strong>OutKast</strong>, and <strong>Frank Ocean</strong>, they aren’t afraid to blend funky basslines, rap-style beats, and pop melodies into their own unique brew. This “groove-pop” ethos, a term coined by Henry, defines Balu Brigada’s evolution: always experimental yet irresistibly catchy. Now based in New York, the brothers continue to push boundaries, self-producing an upcoming debut album that promises to distill their journey into a fresh, genre-defying sound.</p>

                  <h2>Corbin </h2>
                  <h3>Clown On Stage Tour</h3>
                  <h4>w/ Psymun, Bobby Raps</h4>
                  <p>
                  <p><strong>Corbin</strong> (FKA <strong>Spooky Black</strong>) makes captivating, honest, and raw music that harkens back to the days when the singer-songwriter’s artistic vision prioritized vulnerability over image. For over a decade, the <strong>SoundCloud</strong> legend has made moody and intimate R&amp;B that has helped listeners through some of their most difficult times. The 26-year-old St. Paul, Minnesota native came to prominence during the rise of the <strong>SoundCloud</strong> gold rush, influencing a new generation of songwriters. Songs such as the haunting portrait of addiction “Diazepam”, and his battle with insecurity and instability in relationships “ICE BOY”, highlighted his ability to connect with the plight of modern youth. But it was the internet-breaking, classic ballad of yearning “Without You” that inspired a generation of disaffected and abandoned adolescents, serving as a soundtrack to make the alienated feel a little less alone. The song was named one of the best of 2014 by <strong>Complex</strong> and <strong>Consequence Of Sound</strong>. His work, notably 2017’s, <em>Mourn</em>, has been lauded by <strong>Pitchfork</strong>, <strong>Dazed</strong>, <strong>NPR</strong>, and <strong>TheNeedleDrop</strong> and was named one of the best albums of the year by <strong>Dazed</strong>. He’s attracted some of the biggest names in music, featuring on songs with <strong>Chief Keef</strong>, <strong>Trippie Redd</strong>, <strong>Skrillex</strong>, and <strong>The Kid Laroi</strong>, among others. With his latest single, <em>Carbon Monoxide</em>, Corbin presents a down-tempo, piercing work, displaying his familiar aughts of genre-juggling with a degree of vulnerability that’s both earnest and downtrodden. His draught, monochrome lyricism cuts through –– with Corbin posterizing his agony and self-criticism with lyrics like –– &#8220;You can see all the walls I put up caving in / slowly creep in my lungs your my carcinogen.&#8221; Contrasted with glowing guitar riffs and tight drums, an air of poignant melancholy and steward vulnerability –– he pieces together a single that will leave listeners wondering what influences and experiences shaped this, and what will follow for the artist known for his unpredictability and distance. The 9-date US headlining <strong>Clown on Stage</strong> tour kicks off this Spring, giving his fans a long-awaited opportunity to witness the elusive singer and to experience his self-assured reformation.</p>

                  <h3>Flowers Tour 2025</h3>

                  <p>
                  <p><strong>Durand Jones &amp; The Indications</strong> are equally beloved for their energetic, joyous shows, dual lead singers, and thoughtful songwriting. From an Indiana basement (where the band recorded their 2016 self-titled debut LP as college students), the band has catapulted into the soul limelight and onto an international stage. Pushing beyond the boundaries of the funk and soul on their previous releases, The Indications’ third album, <em>Private Space</em>, unlocks the door to a wider range of sounds and launches boldly into a world of synthy modern soul and disco beats dotted with strings. Anchored by a crate-digging sensibility and the high-low harmonies of <strong>Aaron Frazer</strong> and <strong>Durand Jones</strong>, <em>Private Space</em> shows The Indications&#8217; mastery at melding revival sounds with a modern attitude. It&#8217;s an organic, timeless record that’s as fresh as clean kicks and familiar as your favourite well-worn LP.</p>

                  <h2>Bar Italia </h2>
                  <p>
                  <p><strong>bar italia</strong> emerged from London’s underground in 2019 with an enigmatic, DIY spirit that quickly earned cult status among indie die-hards. The trio – <strong>Nina Cristante</strong>, <strong>Sam Fenton</strong>, and <strong>Jezmi Tarik Fehmi</strong> – craft lo-fi, post-punk and shoegaze-infused songs that feel like midnight whispers in a city café. Early releases on <strong>Dean Blunt’s World Music</strong> label, including debut LP <em>Quarrel</em> and follow-up <em>Bedhead</em>, shrouded the band in mystery while showcasing their knack for dissonant yet hooky melodies and raw, bedroom-recorded intimacy. By the time <em>Tracey Denim</em> dropped in 2023, <strong>bar italia</strong> had sharpened their sound without losing their edge – layers of sleety guitars, dual vocals, and woozy atmospherics coalesced into something both haunting and catchy. “We just wanted to write catchy, good songs, not endless experiments,” they’ve hinted, a manifesto reflected in every aching chord and off-kilter pop hook. Influenced by the moody romanticism of <strong>The Cure</strong>, the haze of <strong>Slowdive</strong>, and <strong>Sonic Youth</strong>’s artful noise, <strong>bar italia</strong> channel familiar nostalgia through a fractured, contemporary lens. Their aesthetic – lowercase, low-profile, and laden with moody collage imagery – mirrors the music’s gritty elegance. From the jangling gloom of underground EPs like <em>Angelica Pilled</em> to the recent one-two punch of <em>Tracey Denim</em> and <em>The Twits</em>, bar italia’s evolution is a testament to staying true to one’s DIY roots while quietly redefining the sound of modern alternative rock.</p>

                  <h2>Beach Fossils </h2>
                  <h4>w/ Being Dead</h4>
                  <p>
                  <p><strong>Beach Fossils</strong> is a Brooklyn-based indie band that helped spearhead the lo-fi dream pop movement of the 2010s. From the beginning, they have been known for their hazy, <em>lo-fi, atmospheric sound</em> with confessional, nostalgic lyrics and a laid-back vocal delivery. Early Beach Fossils recordings, largely crafted by frontman Dustin Payseur as a home project, embodied a raw, <em>jangly dream-pop</em> ethos—think reverb-drenched guitars and minimalist percussion creating an aura of wistful summer afternoons.</p>
                  <p>Over time, the band’s music has grown in scope and sophistication. Beach Fossils evolved from the energetic jangle pop of their early releases to a more layered and textured sound rooted in baroque pop and indie rock. Lush arrangements, including the incorporation of strings and woodwinds, began to enrich their songs, lending a fuller, more eclectic sonic depth compared to the straightforward four-piece feel of earlier records. Throughout their albums, the group retained their dreamy, mellow core while refining their melodic sensibilities and songwriting craft. Later tracks showcase nuanced instrumentation and polished melodies, blending gentle guitar hooks with ornate touches and subtle studio experimentation.</p>
                  <p>Today, Beach Fossils’ signature style is both sophisticated and melodic, yet still undeniably dreamy. They strike a balance between nostalgia and growth—bridging their lo-fi dream-pop roots with a matured, graceful indie sound that remains atmospheric and emotionally resonant. The result is a catalog that charts an artistic progression: intimate bedroom pop beginnings blossoming into vibrant, contemplative songs that float with breezy harmonies and earnest, evolved songwriting.</p>

                  <h2>Wednesday </h2>
                  <h4>w/ Daffo</h4>
                  <p>
                  <p><strong>Wednesday</strong> are known for their fuzzy shoegaze guitars and country-tinged storytelling, creating a sound that straddles indie rock and alternative country. Formed in Asheville, NC, the band started as Karly Hartzman’s solo project but soon grew into a full-fledged group. Wednesday’s music marries feedback-drenched noise with lap-steel twang, often dubbed “country-gaze,” yielding “the great fuzzy guitars of shoegaze with a faint Southern twang” in their songs. This distinctive blend provides the backdrop for Hartzman’s evocative lyrics about small-town life and personal memories, delivered with equal parts grit and heart. Over time, Wednesday’s musical evolution has amplified their signature style. Hartzman’s early lo-fi recordings gave way to 2020’s, <em>I Was Trying to Describe You to Someone,</em> where lush shoegaze textures met confessional alt-country lyricism. With <strong>MJ Lenderman</strong> joining on guitar, 2021’s, <em>Twin Plagues,</em> introduced a fuller, more explosive band dynamic. By 2023’s, <em>Rat Saw God,</em> their first release on <strong>Dead Oceans</strong>, <strong>Wednesday</strong> had honed an even bigger, emotionally powerful sound without losing their raw edge. Throughout, the band’s influences range from noisy 90s rock to classic country storytellers, resulting in a potent mix that’s both melancholic and raucous. <strong>Wednesday</strong> stand out for forging a bold, “melting pot” style that is uniquely theirs.<br />
                     Wednesday’s genre-bending approach – <em>equal parts shoegaze haze and alt-country twang</em> – has earned them critical acclaim as one of today’s most exciting indie rock bands. Their catalog shows a band continually pushing their sonic boundaries while staying true to the rough-hewn honesty at their core. <strong>Wednesday</strong> invite listeners into a world where distortion and Southern Gothic imagery collide, producing an electrifying, <strong>“bootgaze”</strong> sound that is instantly recognizable as their own.

                  <h2>Splean </h2>
                  <p>
                  <p>Formed in 1994, Russian rock band <strong>Splean</strong> (<em>Сплин</em>) emerged from St. Petersburg’s alternative scene with raw, guitar-driven energy. Early on, their music bore hallmarks of <strong>alternative rock</strong> and post-grunge angst, but <strong>Splean</strong> never stood still. Lead singer <strong>Alexander Vasilyev</strong> – a literary soul whose very band name nods to poetic melancholia – guided the group through constant reinvention. Over the years, they experimented boldly with genre and style, so much so that newer albums “sound almost nothing like the first ones.” Splean’s signature today is a blend of introspective rock and artful lyricism: <em>brooding folk-rock balladry, dreamy indie sounds, and even electronic or orchestral flourishes</em> coalesce under Vasilyev’s voice. His lyrics, rife with rich metaphors and existential themes, have earned Splean a reputation as “Russia’s poetic rockers,” pairing the <strong>mundane and the profound</strong> in equal measure. The band’s evolution from the edgy angst of 90s albums to the experimental, philosophical tone of recent releases showcases a relentless creative “searching, searching, searching” in Vasilyev’s words. Splean today delivers melodic, genre-blending compositions that retain rock’s bite but prioritize poetic depth and atmospheric experimentation. Fans cherish their ever-evolving sound – one that marries rock riffs with soulful introspection – proving Splean’s music only grows more <em>lyrically poignant and sonically adventurous</em> with time.</p>

                  <h3>Dark Harvest World Tour</h3>
                  <p>
                  <p><strong>Nick Mulvey</strong>’s music unfolds like a sunrise meditation – <em>gentle, radiant, and brimming with soul</em>. In poetic verses and intricate guitar patterns, he sings of inner journeys and global landscapes, drawing on rhythms and modes gleaned from his travels and ethnomusicology studies. A former <strong>Portico Quartet</strong> percussionist who traded the hang drum for a six-string, Mulvey carries a worldly heartbeat into contemporary folk. His songs feel like mantras: <em>each note a step toward spiritual awakening</em>. Listeners drift on warm currents of melody as Mulvey’s soft vocals ponder life’s mysteries – <em>unity and impermanence, self-discovery and surrender</em>.</p>
                  <p>There’s a reverence in his tone, inspired by meditation and nature’s wisdom, that turns each lyric into an introspective prayer. Ever conscious and compassionate, Mulvey invites us to <strong>wake up now</strong> and embrace our shared humanity. He stitches West African grooves to English folk roots, Cuban rhythms to introspective indie, creating an earthy tapestry of sound where personal stories and planetary concerns entwine.</p>
                  <p>In this space, <strong>Nick Mulvey</strong> stands as a gentle bard of the soul – a contemplative songwriter channeling <em>hope, harmony, and the healing power of music</em> in an increasingly disconnected world. Whether he’s whispering intimate truths or calling for global connection, Mulvey’s songs offer comfort and clarity, encouraging listeners to pause, breathe, and reconnect with something deeper within. His music is both a refuge and a reminder: <em>the path inward is the journey home</em>.</p>

                  <h2>Public Service Broadcasting </h2>
                  <h3>North American Tour 2025</h3>
                  <p>
                  <p><strong>Public Service Broadcasting (PSB)</strong> are a London-based band known for their <strong>unique sonic identity</strong> that merges past and future. They weave archival voice samples from old films, newsreels, and propaganda into expansive instrumental tracks, creating a cinematic fusion of post-rock and electronic music. Guitarist/programmer <strong>J. Willgoose, Esq.</strong> and drummer <strong>Wrigglesworth</strong> (with multi-instrumentalist <strong>J.F. Abraham</strong> and visuals artist <strong>Mr. B</strong>) have built a reputation for concept albums that <em>“teach the lessons of the past through the music of the future”</em>.</p>
                  <p>Each album in PSB’s discography explores a distinct theme. Their 2013 debut Inform – Educate – Entertain blended wartime speeches and mountaineering broadcasts with driving rhythms, setting the template for their sample-rich sound. 2015’s The Race for Space celebrated the space race era, layering mission control audio over pulsating krautrock beats. 2017’s Every Valley delved into the rise and fall of Welsh coal mining with poignant interviews and guest vocals. On 2021’s Bright Magic, the band shifted to a more impressionistic approach, capturing the spirit of Berlin with krautrock grooves and sparing use of English vocals. Throughout these releases, PSB’s signature combination of <strong>surging guitar rock, textured electronics, and historic samples</strong> delivers an emotive, educational journey. From triumphant saxophone hooks (“Go!”) to haunting orchestral collaborations (This New Noise), <strong>Public Service Broadcasting</strong> continually evolve while remaining true to their core mission: making the past alive and thrilling in the present.</p>

                  <p>The Masonic Temple was opened with great ceremony on January 1, 1918. Owned by an independent corporation of Masons, the Temple was intended to house a disparate group of lodges and chapters; at one point, thirty-eight different groups called the temple home.</p>
                  <p>Unlike the rest of the Temple, the Concert Hall was intended as rental public space to help defray operating costs, with dressing rooms, a stage, and food preparation areas.</p>
                  <p>It’s been known by many names as music and owners changed: The Concert Hall; The Auditorium; Club 888; The Rockpile, Regency Ballroom. The Concert hall started out mainly being used as a lecture-hall (“<a href="images/posters/chesterton.png" class="popup">G. K. Chesterton: Literature as Luggage</a>”), ballroom (“<a href="images/posters/public-dancing.jpg" class="popup">Canada’s Largest Public Dance Every Wed. – Fri. – Sat.</a>”) and to host community concerts.</p>
               </div>
               <div class="col-sm-3">
                  <p>That’s not to say there weren’t more fantastic events too - Frank Sinatra used to rent the building for private parties, and the Rolling Stones used the space as a summer rehearsal studio for years.</p>
                  <p>The Concert Hall started to gain traction as a rock concert venue in the 1960s, attracting performers like Wilson Pickett, Tina Turner, Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears, Johnny Lee Hooker, Canned Heat, and Buddy Guy by 1968.</p>
                  <p>1969 was a massive year: <a href="images/posters/led-zeppelin2.jpg" class="popup">Led Zeppelin</a>, Muddy Waters, Frank Zappa, Chuck Berry, The Who, B. B. King, the Grateful Dead, Mothers of Invention. And that was just a lead into the 70s: The Animals, <a href="images/posters/iggy-pop2.jpg" class="popup">Iggy Pop</a>, <a href="images/posters/ramones.png" class="popup">The Ramones</a>, <a href="images/posters/toots.jpg" class="popup">Toots and the Maytals</a>, Hugh Masekela. The 80s starred Iron Maiden, <a href="images/posters/the-cure.png" class="popup">The Cure</a>, <a href="images/posters/dead-kennedys.jpg" class="popup">Dead Kennedys</a>, King Crimson and Depeche Mode</p>
               </div>
               <div class="col-sm-3">
                  <p>But things were starting to look bleak. The Building’s condition had rapidly deteriorated throughout the 70s, and as Masons started moving to the suburbs, the Temple started to fall on hard times. The corporation started looking to sell in the mid 90s, but the bands played on, ranging from <a href="images/posters/vanilla-ice.png" class="popup">Vanilla Ice</a> to <a href="images/posters/weird-al.jpg" class="popup">Weird Al Yankovic</a>, <a href="images/posters/tragically-hip.png" class="popup">The Tragically Hip</a> to <a href="images/posters/ice-t.jpg" class="popup">Ice-T</a>. <a href="images/posters/rage-against-the-machine.png" class="popup">Rage Against the Machine</a>. Phish. <a href="images/posters/queen-latifah.png" class="popup">Queen Latifah</a>. David Bowie. <a href="images/posters/pearl-jam.png" class="popup">Pearl Jam</a> &amp; The Smashing Pumpkins opened for The Red Hot Chili Peppers. Green Day opened for Bad Religion. It wasn’t enough.</p>
                  <p>The building narrowly escaped demolition in 1997 by being declared a heritage site (the ‘lucky’ 888 address was coveted by developers). CTV bought it in 1998 as a news bureau and venue for the Mike Bullard show. MTV took over in 2006, and, despite closing the Concert Hall, still managed to cage a performance from U2 in 2009.</p>
               </div>
               <div class="col-sm-3">
                  <p>MTV decided to up-stakes and move down to Queen Street in 2012, but the Temple only had to wait a year before Info-Tech Research Group bought and thoroughly renovated it. The Concert Hall has been opened for special events, like listening sessions lead by Jimmy Page, concerts by Luke and the Apostles and Platinum Blond, boxing events, and much more. Now that 888 Yonge Inc. has the reins, we can expect more fantastic events in this beautiful, historic space.</p>
