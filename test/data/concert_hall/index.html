      				  <h2>Unwound </h2>


                      <p><p><strong>Unwound</strong>, a seminal post-hardcore band hailing from the Pacific Northwest, emerged as a compelling force in the early 1990s, melding the intensity of punk with experimental and noise rock elements. Formed in Olympia, Washington, in 1991, the trio consisted of Justin Trosper (vocals and guitar), Vern Rumsey (bass), and Brandt Sandeno (drums), with Sara Lund later replacing Sandeno to solidify the lineup. Their sound, characterized by angular guitar riffs, dissonant harmonies, and introspective lyrics, captured the angst and disillusionment of the era while pushing the boundaries of the post-hardcore genre.</p>

<p><strong>Unwound</strong>&#8216;s journey began in the shadows of the grunge movement, offering an alternative that was less commercial and more artistically inclined. Their debut album, <em>Fake Train</em> (1993), was released on the independent label <strong>Kill Rock Stars</strong>, marking the beginning of a prolific and influential career. Over the next decade, <strong>Unwound</strong> released a series of critically acclaimed albums, including, <em>New Plastic Ideas</em> (1994), <em>The Future of What</em> (1995), and their magnum opus, <em>Leaves Turn Inside You</em> (2001). These records showcased the band&#8217;s evolution from their punk roots to more complex and textured soundscapes.</p>

<p><strong>Unwound</strong>&#8216;s commitment to DIY ethics and their refusal to conform to mainstream expectations helped them maintain a loyal underground following. Despite never achieving the commercial success of their contemporaries, their impact on the post-hardcore scene and alternative music at large is undeniable. The band&#8217;s dissolution in 2002 left a legacy of innovation and integrity, influencing a new generation of musicians who sought to challenge the conventions of rock music. <strong>Unwound</strong>&#8216;s discography remains a testament to their artistic vision and the enduring power of their music.</p></p>

                      <p><p>DIIV, formed in Brooklyn in 2011 by frontman Zachary Cole Smith, is a band that masterfully blends shoegaze, dream pop, and post-punk elements to create a sound that&#8217;s both ethereal and grounding. Known for their atmospheric instrumentals, introspective lyrics, and immersive live performances, DIIV has carved a unique niche within the indie rock landscape. Their debut album, <em>Oshin</em>, released in 2012, was critically acclaimed for its innovative soundscapes and emotional depth, establishing the band as key players in the revival of &#8216;90s shoegaze and early 2000s indie rock aesthetics.<br />
Following <em>Oshin</em>, DIIV released <em>Is the Is Are</em> in 2016 and <em>Deceiver</em> in 2019, both of which saw the band exploring darker themes and more complex musical arrangements, further solidifying their reputation for pushing the boundaries of genre and emotion.<br />
Join us at The Concert Hall, in Toronto’s historic Masonic Temple as DIIV showcase their latest masterpiece, <em>Frog in Boiling Water</em>.</p></p>

      				  <h2>Crumb </h2>

                      <h4>w/ L’Rain, Discovery Zone</h4>
                      <p><p>New York psych-pop band <strong>Crumb</strong> return with <em>AMAMA</em>, their most carefree and open-hearted album to date. A soundscape full of playful and patchwork experimentation — glitchy pitch-shifted vocals, cell phone recordings, nautical blips, sax mouthpiece solos, blasted drum samples, and piano strings dampened with Silly Putty — <em>AMAMA</em> continues to deepen the band’s hypnotic sound in a cohesive line back through 2021’s <em>Ice Melt</em>, 2019’s <em>Jinx</em>, and breakout EPs <em>Locket</em> and <em>Crumb</em>. Without a doubt, <em>AMAMA</em> is <strong>Crumb</strong> — singer and multi-instrumentalist <strong>Lila Ramani</strong>, keyboardist and saxophonist <strong>Bri Aronow</strong>, bassist <strong>Jesse Brotter</strong>, and drummer <strong>Jonathan Gilad</strong> — at their most animated.<br />
Buoyed by Ramani’s songwriting, at turns poetically abstract and directly confessional, <em>AMAMA</em> culls the strange encounters from Crumb’s touring years, tracing the dizzying path of a group that’s been in movement for nearly a decade. “Crushxd” is an ecstatic requiem for a turtle flattened under the tires of a tour van; “(Alone in) Brussels” finds Ramani in forced isolation in a distant city. On “The Bug,” we’re at a pit stop in a seedy motel, where a critter’s bite leaves a nagging feeling: “It’s always on my mind / it’s just always on my mind,” Ramani repeats over a creeping groove as she wanders the place at night. On “Side by Side,” perhaps the most candid track on <em>AMAMA</em>, frenetic percussion and disorienting, layered synth envelop Ramani as she considers the personal sacrifices she’s made along the way.<br />
Even as it explores transient stops and fraught encounters, <em>AMAMA</em> features some of Crumb’s most vulnerable, tender searches for organic connection. “Home is what I want and what I need,” Ramani sings on the clear-sighted opener, “From Outside a Window Sill”—which samples a police radio scan about a flock of geese crossing a bridge in Gowanus, Brooklyn, where Ramani grew up. The title track, “AMAMA,” is an upbeat and hopeful homage to Ramani’s grandmother, her namesake, who sings in Malayalam in the opening sample. The two voices, Lila’s and Leela’s, separated by language and place, intertwine as if on a spotty long-distance call in what is the most direct love song of Crumb’s repertoire. On the album’s closer, “XXX,” laden with distorted, industrial sounds, we finally find respite—a house shared between two lovers, a safe place. In the last moments, Ramani asks: “Isn’t this as good as it can get?”<br />
<em>AMAMA</em> exists at the crossroads of psychedelia, pop, jazz, and rock, and cements Crumb as a band uniquely their own. Released independently on <strong>Crumb Records</strong> and produced alongside <strong>Johnscott Sanford</strong> and <strong>Jonathan Rado</strong> in Los Angeles, <em>AMAMA</em> is an incandescent statement about searching for solid ground, connection, and clarity in a life of nomadic upheaval.</p></p>

                      <h3>First Mind 10th Anniversary Tour</h3>

                      <p><p>The acclaimed artist and songwriter <strong>Nick Mulvey</strong> has become known for his powerful ability to emotionally connect, inspire and gather a global audience and community by touching hearts experientially, musically and philosophically. The musician, composer and producer&#8217;s work pushes boundaries in song writing and sound; bridging both traditional and experimental, acoustic and electronic. A founding member of the award-winning British collective <strong>Portico Quartet</strong>, he left in 2011 to concentrate on his own material. Once solo, his 2014 Mercury Prize nominated debut album, <em>First Mind</em>, set the tone for next level of recognition and accreditation, globally. This First Mind 10th Anniversary tour sees Nick&#8217;s personal and creative development reimagine this iconic album and bring it to life with the benefit of ten years of learning, wisdom and reflection. Nick&#8217;s talent for creating evocative music interwoven with poetic, considered lyrics creates an energy at every live show which fuels a feeling of rising together to celebrate the powerful impact of music to humanity. We now see Nick step into his truth and power to deliver performances and material which is compelling, profound and has the ability to speak to us all.</p></p>

      				  <h2>The Lox </h2>
                      <h3>30th Anniversary Tour</h3>

                      <p><p><strong>The Lox</strong>, an iconic rap group hailing from Yonkers, New York, emerged in the early &#8216;90s, carving a distinctive niche within the hip-hop scene with their gritty lyrical content and authentic street narratives. Comprising <strong>Jadakiss</strong>, <strong>Styles P</strong>, and <strong>Sheek Louch</strong>, the trio initially gained prominence under the mentorship of <strong>Mary J. Blige</strong>, which led to their signing with <strong>Bad Boy Records</strong>. Their debut album, <em>Money, Power &amp; Respect</em> (1998), was a commercial success, bolstered by the hit title track, and solidified their presence in the rap industry.</p>

<p>Despite their initial success, <strong>The Lox</strong> became disillusioned with the glossy image imposed by <strong>Bad Boy</strong> and made a high-profile switch to <strong>Ruff Ryders Entertainment</strong>. This move marked a turning point, allowing them to express their raw and unfiltered street ethos more freely. Their sophomore album, <em>We Are the Streets</em> (2000), reflected this shift, earning critical acclaim for its hard-hitting lyrics and rugged beats.</p>

<p>Beyond their group projects, <strong>Jadakiss</strong>, <strong>Styles P</strong>, and <strong>Sheek Louch</strong> have each enjoyed successful solo careers, releasing numerous albums that have been well received by fans and critics alike. However, their chemistry as <strong>The Lox</strong> remains unparalleled, leading to further collaborative projects, including, <em>Filthy America&#8230; It&#8217;s Beautiful</em> (2016), and, <em>Living Off Xperience</em> (2020), which showcased their evolution while staying true to their roots.</p>

<p>Renowned for their lyrical prowess, cohesive group dynamic, and contributions to the evolution of hardcore rap, <strong>The Lox</strong> have solidified their legacy as stalwarts of hip-hop, respected by peers and revered by fans across generations.</p></p>

      				  <h2>Amen Dunes </h2>


                      <p><p><strong>Amen Dunes</strong> is the musical project founded by American musician and singer-songwriter <strong>Damon McMahon</strong>. The project emerged quietly yet profoundly in the late 2000s, becoming known for its blend of folk, psychedelic rock, and lo-fi aesthetics. <strong>McMahon</strong> began his musical career in New York City, but the project truly took form after a soul-searching sojourn in China where he created the first Amen Dunes album, <em>DIA</em>, released in 2009. This debut set the tone for <em>Amen Dunes&#8217;</em> introspective and often raw lyrical themes, matched with haunting melodies and minimalist arrangements.</p>

<p>Over the years, <strong>McMahon</strong> has been the core of <strong>Amen Dunes</strong>, with a revolving cast of musicians contributing to its evolving sound. The band&#8217;s work is marked by its experimental edge, emotional transparency, and a disregard for genre confines, inviting listeners into <strong>McMahon&#8217;s</strong> reflective musings.</p>

<p>The subsequent albums, like, <em>Through Donkey Jaw</em>, in 2011, and, <em>Love</em>, in 2014, saw <strong>Amen Dunes</strong> gaining critical acclaim, with McMahon&#8217;s songwriting becoming more intricate and his production more polished. The band&#8217;s fifth album, <em>Freedom</em> (2018), was a breakthrough, with tracks like, <em>Miki Dora</em>, and, <em>Blue Rose</em>, reflecting a more accessible sound that did not sacrifice the project&#8217;s distinctive ethereal and contemplative essence. This record expanded their fan base and brought a new level of recognition.</p>

<p><strong>Amen Dunes</strong>&#8217; music is characterized by a search for authenticity and an exploration of personal and universal themes. It&#8217;s a journey through <strong>McMahon&#8217;s</strong> life experiences, set against the backdrop of his moody, psych-inflected musical landscapes. With each release, <strong>Amen Dunes</strong> manages to reinvent itself while maintaining an intimate connection with its audience, solidifying <strong>McMahon&#8217;s</strong> status as a unique and influential voice in contemporary indie music.</p></p>

      				  <h2>Bôa <span class="sold-out">Sold Out!</span></h2>

                      <h4>w/ Rocket</h4>
                      <p><p>British alt-rock band <strong>bôa</strong> have reformed following an incredible renaissance for their track, <em>Duvet</em>, driven by TikTok fans the world over. Originally released in 1998, and placed as the soundtrack to cult-classic anime series, <em>Serial Experiments Lain</em>, <em>Duvet</em>, became a viral hit on social media towards the end of 2021 – sparking an ongoing, enormous interest in the group that lead to millions of streams across their entire catalogue. Now signed to <strong>Nettwerk Music Group</strong>, the song has continued to trend throughout 2022 and even entered an incredible third resurgence in May 2023.<br />
Following the initial viral trend that saw, <em>Duvet</em>, streaming into the millions, <strong>bôa</strong> have reconnected as a band and with fans to continue to build on that initial moment. Garnering well over 100 Million streams over the last year, and over 200,000 fans across social media, the growth of the band still continues.<br />
Fronted by Jasmine Rodgers, daughter of Paul Rodgers (Free, Bad Company), with Alex Caird on bass and Lee Sullivan on drums, <strong>bôa</strong> had mostly dispersed over the last few years with members following solo careers. Inspired by the growing interest in their past releases, they have garnered an exceptionally invested new fanbase – clamoring for more from <strong>bôa</strong>.<br />
<strong>bôa</strong> have returned to the studio in 2023 to record new original music, with new releases anticipated later this year.<br />
Supporting act, <strong>Rocket</strong>, is an emerging musical group that has quickly captured the hearts of fans across the globe. Known for their electrifying performances and unique sound, <strong>Rocket</strong> blends elements of rock, indie, and electronic music to create an unforgettable auditory experience. Formed in 2020, the band consists of four members: Alex on vocals and guitar, Jamie on keyboards, Morgan on bass, and Casey on drums. Each member brings a distinct musical background, contributing to the band&#8217;s diverse soundscapes and lyrical depth. <strong>Rocket&#8217;s</strong> debut EP, <em>Launch Sequence</em>, received critical acclaim for its innovative production and emotional resonance, establishing the band as a rising star in the music industry.</p></p>

      				  <h2>Yard Act </h2>
                      <h3>Where's My Utopia Tour</h3>

                      <p><p>What do you do when everything you’ve ever wanted suddenly lands in your lap, but the questions still keep on coming?<br />
Since first steering their golden Rover into swift public acclaim back in 2020, Leeds quartet <strong>Yard Act</strong> have become one of the great indie success stories of the decade so far. Along the way, they’ve ticked off milestones ranging from a Number Two chart placing and Mercury Prize nomination for debut album, <em>The Overload</em>, to a co-sign from <strong>Elton John</strong> who joined the band to guest on a string-laden reworking of album closer ‘100% Endurance’.<br />
Yet, whilst the band’s trajectory continuously shot upwards, vocalist <strong>James Smith</strong> and his wife had also welcomed in a son. And it’s this duelling sense of responsibility and ambition, guilt, love, drive and everything in between that forms the narrative backbone of brilliantly exploratory second album, <em>Where’s My Utopia?</em><br />
Written in snapshots of time between a relentless touring schedule, and produced jointly by the band and <strong>Gorillaz’ Remi Kabaka Jr</strong>, the quartet’s second act is a giant leap forward into broad and playful new sonic waters. “The main reason that ‘post-punk’ was the vehicle for Album One was because it was really affordable to do, but we always liked so much other music and this time we’ve had the confidence to embrace it,” James explains. Across the record, influences ranging from <strong>Fela Kuti</strong> to <strong>Ennio Moricone</strong> via Spiller’s ‘00s pop smash ‘Groovejet’ make themselves known.<br />
It’s a celebratory palette upon which Smith allowed himself to reach lyrically deeper into himself than ever. Gone, largely, are the outward-facing character studies of yore, replaced with a set of songs that stare fully into the headlights of life, wrangling with the frontman’s own fears and foibles to create a sort of Promethean narrative - but with jokes. “You can commit to the idea that we’re just animals who eat and fuck and then we die, and that’s fine,” he suggests. “But for me, creativity always seems to be the best way of articulating the absolute minefield of what human existence is.”</p></p>

                      <h3>Night Owls Tour 2024</h3>
                      <h4>w/ Kate Clover</h4>
                      <p><p>Over the past 12 years, <strong>JD McPherson</strong> has carved out a unique musical path, releasing four studio albums and two EPs that blend foundational rock ‘n’ roll, rockabilly, and R&amp;B with his distinct songwriting style. Hailing from Broken Arrow, Oklahoma, JD is deeply inspired by classic sounds yet approaches his music with a fresh, innovative twist. “I love those old styles, but I don’t treat my music like a museum piece. It’s more about mixing those rhythms and sounds and seeing what comes out,” he says.</p>

<p>This creative philosophy shines through in his latest album, <em>Nite Owls</em>. His fifth studio release features ten dynamic rock ‘n’ roll tracks that incorporate elements of glam, new wave, post-punk, and surf rock. JD connects these diverse influences seamlessly, noting, “The thread between <strong>Duane Eddy</strong> and <strong>Depeche Mode</strong> is that reverb-y guitar style. It felt natural to blend that with the classic stuff and a dash of surf.”</p>

<p><em>Nite Owls</em> opens with “Sunshine Getaway,” a catchy glam rock track with a darker lyrical undercurrent. Collaborating with Jack and Page from the <strong>Cactus Blossoms</strong>, the song reflects on harsh winters and dreams of sunnier days. The album continues to showcase JD’s versatility with tracks like the r&amp;b rave-up “I Can’t Go Anywhere With You” and the melancholic dream-pop of “Just Like Summer.”</p>

<p>JD’s storytelling prowess is evident in the title track’s vivid narratives and the Beach Boys-esque harmonies of “That’s What a Love Song Does to You.” He also collaborates with Ryan Lindsay of <strong>Broncho</strong> on “Shining Like Gold,” a breezy love song. Longtime fans will appreciate familiar elements in songs like “The Rock and Roll Girls” and “Baby Blues.”</p>

<p>Throughout <em>Nite Owls</em>, JD’s enthusiasm and passion for music are palpable. Reflecting on his journey, he shares, “I’m just trying to share an infectious enthusiasm. I want to enjoy myself and make the music I love, and I’m so grateful I get to do this for a living.”</p></p>

      				  <h2>Mdou Moctar </h2>
                      <h3>Funeral for Justice Tour</h3>

                      <p><p><em>Funeral For Justice</em>, is the new album by <strong>Mdou Moctar</strong>. Recorded at the close of two years spent touring the globe following the release of 2019 breakout, <em>Afrique Victime</em>, it captures the Nigerien quartet in ferocious form. The music is louder, faster, and more wild. The guitar solos are feedback-scorched and the lyrics are passionately political. Nothing is held back or toned down.<br />
The songs on <em>Funeral For Justice</em> speak unflinchingly to the plight of Niger and of the Tuareg people. &#8220;This album is really different for me,&#8221; explains Moctar, the band’s singer, namesake, and indisputably iconic guitarist. &#8220;Now the problems of terrorist violence are more serious in Africa. When the US and Europe came here, they said they&#8217;re going to help us, but what we see is really different. They never help us to find a solution.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Mdou Moctar has been a strong anti-colonial band ever since I&#8217;ve been a part of it,&#8221; says producer and bassist <strong>Mikey Coltun</strong>, who has been playing with Moctar since 2017. &#8220;France came in, fucked up the country, then said ‘you&#8217;re free.’ And they&#8217;re not.&#8221; The song ‘Oh France’ tackles this head on: &#8220;France&#8217;s actions are frequently veiled in cruelty/We are better off without its turbulent relation/It’s high time we grasp the endless lethal games it plays.&#8221;<br />
On the lead single and title track, Moctar addresses African leaders directly, bidding them: &#8220;Retake control of your resource rich countries/Build them and quit sleeping”. The song ‘Sousoume Tamacheq’ deals with the plight of the Tuareg people to which the band belong, and who are mainly spread across three countries: Niger, Mali and Algeria. &#8220;Oppressed in all three/In addition to lack of unity, ignorance is the third issue.&#8221; Another song, ‘Imouhar’, calls on the Tuareg to preserve their Tamasheq language - it&#8217;s at risk of dying out, and Mdou is one of the few in his community who knows how to write it. &#8220;People here are just using French,&#8221; laments Mdou. &#8220;They&#8217;re starting to forget their own language. We feel like in a hundred years no one will speak good Tamasheq, and that&#8217;s so scary for us.&#8221;<br />
<strong>Mdou Moctar</strong> in its current iteration is first and foremost a band. Alongside Moctar, it consists of rhythm guitarist <strong>Ahmoudou Madassane</strong>, drummer <strong>Souleymane Ibrahim</strong>, and American bassist and producer <strong>Mikey Coltun</strong>.<br />
The band got their start performing at traditional weddings. These are high energy events – amps are dialed up to 11 and the whole town is invited to attend. &#8220;I grew up in the DC punk scene and this is no different,&#8221; explains Coltun. &#8220;It’s a DIY punk show: people bring generators, they crank their amps. Things are broken, but they make it work.&#8221;<br />
Conveying that energy and feeling of community to a new audience has been an important goal for the band. Their first concerts in the US were sometimes, mistakenly, organized to be tame seated affairs. That’s no longer the case. Over 100s of shows, they’ve proven themselves as one of the world’s most vital rock bands – a group rooted in Tuareg tradition, but undeniably its own singular organism. An <strong>Mdou Moctar</strong> concert is now recognized to be a place for dancing, if not full-force moshing.<br />
&#8220;Ilana was the gateway album, saying that this is a raw rock band. And <em>Afrique Victime</em> was a summation of that vision,” says Coltun, who captured the bulk of the recordings over five days in a mostly unfurnished house in upstate New York. “With <em>Funeral For Justice</em>, I really wanted this to shine with the political message because of everything that&#8217;s going on. As the band got tighter and heavier live, it made sense to capture this urgency and this aggression – it wasn&#8217;t a forced thing, it was very natural.”<br />
In July 2023 – after <em>Funeral For Justice</em> had been completed – Niger’s democratically elected government was deposed in a military coup. The president was placed under house arrest and the nation plunged into a state of chaos and uncertainty. The French have withdrawn. The area continues to be threatened by terrorism. The band – then on tour in the US – was, for a time, unable to return to their families. <br />
&#8220;I don&#8217;t support the coup,&#8221; explains Mdou, &#8220;but I never in my life liked France in my country. I don&#8217;t hate France or French people, I don&#8217;t hate American people either, but I don&#8217;t support their manipulative policies, what they do in Africa. In 2023 we want to be free, we need to smile, you understand?&#8221;</p></p>

      				  <h2>Ginger Root </h2>
                      <h3>Ginger Root’s SHINBANGUMI Tour</h3>

                      <p><p>A multi-instrumentalist, producer, songwriter, and visual artist from Southern California, Cameron Lew has crafted his <strong>Ginger Root</strong> project steadily since 2017, inviting a fervent and growing legion of fans into storylines drawn across mediums: captivating albums with accompanying films and globe-spanning tours. The Ginger Root sound — handmade yet immaculately polished synth-pop, alt-disco, boogie, and soul — takes shape through Lew’s lens as an Asian-American growing up enamored by 1970s and ‘80s music, specifically the creative and cultural dialogue between Japanese City Pop and its Western counterparts from French Pop to Philly Soul to Ram-era McCartney. SHINBANGUMI, his long-awaited third LP, and Ghostly International debut set for physical release in 2024 with a visual album component, translates roughly to a new season of a show. It finds Lew more poised, idiosyncratic, and intentional than ever in a new chapter of life, unlocking “exactly what Ginger Root should sound and feel like,” he says. “In terms of instrumentation and musicality, it’s the first time that I felt very confident and comfortable with what everything should be comprised of. On the more personal side, I’m coming out of the last four years of writing, touring, and living as a different person; SHINBANGUMI is a platform to showcase my new self.”<br />
Since his first release of “aggressive elevator soul” music and dispatch from his beloved weekly YouTube cover series during college, Lew has captained the ship of Ginger Root, able to write, record, and mix the music while creating the art and videos from scratch. What makes Ginger Root special is the project’s ability to weave influence beyond pastiche into a bigger picture, exploring that rarified pop pleasure center where referential meets refreshing.<br />
In 2018, the project delivered its first album in collaboration with Acrophase Record, Mahjong Room, followed by several projects including the 2020 LP, Rikki. Between each move, Ginger Root has played alongside many modern Indie standouts, such as Khruangbin, Durand Jones, Omar Apollo, The Marias, and Hippo Campus.<br />
With much of Rikki’s release feeling lost to the moments of that year, Lew decided to take a step back and try to write a succinct project to engage listeners for as long as possible. His redirected energy, paired with the newfound influence of Japanese art and culture from his experience learning to speak the language, yielded City Slicker in 2021. On the strength of breakout songs like “Juban District” and “Loretta,” the project connected with a massive audience on the internet, with his YouTube amassing 160,000 subscribers and his Spotify nearly hitting 1 million monthly listeners.<br />
Ginger Root released the Nisemono EP in 2022 and has since played sold-out shows across North America, Europe, and Asia as fans await new music. In 2024, Ginger Root presents SHINBANGUMI across a sequential music video series, resuming the conceptual narrative from his 2022 EP Nisemono, which follows Ginger Root as a newly-fired music supervisor in 1987 starting his own media conglomerate, Ginger Root Productions. “If you watch music videos one through eight, you’ll be presented with a story that’s comparable to a traditional movie; something I’ve always wanted to do.”</p>

                      <h4>w/ Jayson Green & The Jerk</h4>
                      <p><p>Four years on from the release of their unexpectedly self-assured debut album, NYC based <strong>Nation of Language</strong> have attracted a rapidly growing international audience via their danceable and impassioned take on new wave, post-punk &amp; shoegaze genres. Following the critical acclaim of their their first LP, <em>Introduction, Presence</em>, its 2021 follow-up, <em>A Way Forward</em>, pushed them to a wider audience—landing them their late-night TV debut on, <em>The Late Show with Stephen Colbert</em>, and a string of sold out tours—and their 2023 record, <em>Strange Disciple</em>, has continued this momentum, landing Rough Trade’s coveted #1 album of the year spot. Now a mainstay atop lists of the best live acts of recent years, the band continue to charge synth-first into their latest chapter as a major festival draw at recent iterations of <strong>Austin City Limits Festival</strong>, <strong>Desert Daze</strong>, <strong>Pitchfork Festival</strong>, <strong>Primavera Sound</strong>, <strong>Corona Capital</strong>, <strong>Outside Lands</strong>, <strong>Bonnaroo</strong> and many others.</p></p>

Since their discovery, HCTM has been direct support for <strong>P-Funk</strong>, <strong>Al Green</strong>, <strong>Mavis Staples</strong>, <strong>KC and the Sunshine Band</strong>, and <strong>Cheap Trick</strong>; rocked <strong>Super Bowl Village</strong>; become a regular on <strong>The Bob and Tom Show</strong>; appeared on <strong>That’s My Jam with Jimmy Fallon</strong>; played massive festivals like Summer Fest, Summer Camp, Common Ground, Musikfest, and Suwannee Hulaween; and sold tickets by the thousands across large swaths of North America. Maybe that’s why the ladies (and some dudes) can’t stop losing their minds over these mayhem-inducing mavens of mirth.<br />
Some say they were cursed after deflowering a great Pharaoh’s daughter. Others claim they are reincarnated Grammy-Winning studio musicians. Regardless, HCTM’s mysterious personas, cunning song-craft, and unrelenting live show will bend your brain, and melt your face. Get ready! <strong>Here Come The Mummies</strong>.</p></p>

      				  <h2>Godspeed You! Black Emperor </h2>
                      <h3>On American High</h3>

                      <p><p><strong>Godspeed You! Black Emperor</strong> released a string of albums from 1997-2002 widely recognized as redefining what protest music can be, where longform instrumental chamber rock compositions of immense feeling and power serve as soundtracks to late capitalist alienation and resistance. The band’s first four releases—especially, <em>F#A#∞</em> (1997), and, <em>Lift Your Skinny Fists Like Antennas To Heaven</em> (2000), are variously regarded as classics of the era and genre. Godspeed&#8217;s legendary live performances, featuring multiple 16mm projectors beaming a collage of overlapping analog film loops and reels—along with the distinctive iconography, imagery and tactility of the band&#8217;s album artwork and physical LP packages— further defines the <em>sui generis</em> aesthetic substance, ethos and mythos of this group. GY!BE has issued two official band photos in its 25-year existence and has done a half-dozen collectively-answered written interviews over that same span. The band has never had a website or social media accounts. It has never made a video. Few rock bands in our 21st century have been as steadfast in trying to let the work speak for itself and maintaining simple rules about minimizing participation in cultures of personality, exposure, access, commodification or co-optation.<br />
Following a seven-year hiatus that began in 2003, Godspeed returned to the stage in December 2010 (curating the UK festival, <em>All Tomorrow’s Parties</em>) and the band’s post-reunion period has now lasted over a decade, marked by hundreds of sold-out live shows and three additional albums, all of which have been met with high acclaim.<br />
<em>G_d’s Pee AT STATE’S END!</em>, the band’s fourth post-reunion album (and eighth overall), was released in April, 2021.</p></p>

      				  <h2>Chat Pile </h2>

                      <h4>w/ Agriculture, Traindodge</h4>
                      <p><p><strong>Chat Pile</strong> is a sludge metal powerhouse straight out of Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. Bursting onto the scene in 2019, the band wasted no time carving out a reputation for their raw, unfiltered noise. Drawing from the depths of noise rock, post-punk, and doom metal, <strong>Chat Pile</strong> is a sonic assault led by Raygun Busch&#8217;s feral vocals, Luther Manhole&#8217;s blistering guitar, Stin&#8217;s bone-rattling bass, and Captain Ron&#8217;s relentless drumming.</p>

<p>Their name, <strong>Chat Pile</strong>, is a nod to the toxic waste piles left by lead mining in their home state, perfectly capturing their corrosive and confrontational sound. Chat Pile&#8217;s music is a relentless onslaught of abrasive riffs, crushing bass lines, and pummeling drums, all wrapped in Busch&#8217;s unhinged vocal delivery. Their lyrics are a dark descent into themes of existential dread, societal decay, and personal anguish, serving up a bleak reflection of modern life.</p>

<p>Their debut album, <em>God&#8217;s Country</em>, dropped in 2022 and hit like a sledgehammer. Critics and fans alike were drawn to its unapologetic intensity and dark, atmospheric undertones. With raw energy and gut-wrenching emotion, <em>God&#8217;s Country</em>, solidified <strong>Chat Pile</strong> as a brutal force in the underground metal world.</p>

<p>Chat Pile&#8217;s live shows are a maelstrom of energy and chaos, leaving audiences both stunned and exhilarated. Their fierce dedication to authenticity and their fearless exploration of darkness have earned them a rabid following.</p>

<p>Relentlessly pushing the boundaries of sludge metal, <strong>Chat Pile</strong> is a band that refuses to be ignored, making waves as one of the most electrifying and influential acts in the genre today.</p></p>

      				  <h2>HONNE </h2>
                      <h3>The Ouch Tour</h3>

                      <p><p><strong>HONNE</strong>, an electronic music duo from London, has captivated audiences worldwide with their soulful and emotive soundscapes since their formation in 2014. Comprising <strong>Andy Clutterbuck</strong> (singer, producer) and <strong>James Hatcher</strong> (producer), the pair has seamlessly blended electronic beats with heartfelt lyrics, crafting a unique sound that resonates with listeners on a deep emotional level.</p>

<p><strong>HONNE</strong>&#8216;s music is characterized by its warm, smooth melodies and introspective lyrics, often exploring themes of love, longing, and the complexities of human relationships. Their debut album, <em>Warm on a Cold Night</em> (2016), set the tone with its evocative tracks, quickly gaining critical acclaim and a loyal fanbase. Songs like &#8220;Someone That Loves You&#8221; and &#8220;Warm on a Cold Night&#8221; became anthems for late-night musings and intimate moments.</p>

<p>Following the success of their debut, <strong>HONNE</strong> continued to evolve their sound with their sophomore album, <em>Love Me / Love Me Not</em> (2018), which delved into the dualities of love and life. The album featured collaborations with artists like <strong>Tom Misch</strong> and <strong>Nana Rogues</strong>, showcasing their versatility and ability to innovate within their genre.</p>

<p>In 2021, <strong>HONNE</strong> released, <em>No Song Without You</em>, an album that further solidified their reputation as masters of modern romance music. The record offered a more stripped-back, acoustic approach, highlighting their growth and maturity as artists.</p>

For nearly two decades, this trio has captivated audiences with their innovative songwriting, dynamic performances, and community spirit. Their latest album, <em>Heart is the Hero</em>, marks a new chapter in their journey, blending acoustic-driven sounds with the raw energy of their live shows, all recorded analog to 16-track tape.</p>

This approach emphasizes creativity and intentionality, focusing on the performance&#8217;s feel rather than relying on digital fixes. The result is an album that resonates deeply with the heart, head, and hips alike.</p>

<p><em>Heart is the Hero</em>, showcases the band&#8217;s storytelling prowess and songwriting skills, transcending the boundaries of American roots music. Songs like, <em>Pilgrim</em>, and, <em>Between the Beats</em>, encourage listeners to savor life&#8217;s moments and achieve mindfulness. Meanwhile, tracks like, <em>Rollin&#8217; On</em>, and, <em>Mean Man World</em>, explore themes of love, responsibility, and compassion. The harmonious, <em>Line Those Pockets</em>, calls for mercy and understanding, emphasizing grace over materialism.</p>

<p>This album, with its blend of acoustic guitar, upright bass, and percussion, embodies <strong>The Wood Brothers&#8217;</strong> quest to innovate while staying true to their roots. <em>Heart is the Hero</em>, is a bold, bright, and creative masterpiece, reflecting the band&#8217;s dedication to exploring new musical territories.</p>

<p>Join us for an unforgettable night with <strong>The Wood Brothers</strong>, and experience the unexpected as they push musical boundaries and deliver performances that are greater than the sum of their parts. Don&#8217;t miss out on witnessing this Grammy-nominated group at the peak of their powers, as they continue to inspire and evolve.</p></p>

                      <p><p><strong>Marc Rebillet</strong>, also popularly known by his stage name &#8220;Loop Daddy,&#8221; is a dynamic American electronic musician, singer, and internet sensation renowned for his improvisational performance style. Born on December 15, 1988, in Dallas, Texas, Rebillet&#8217;s musical journey began at a young age, influenced heavily by a vibrant mix of classical music, jazz, and a deep appreciation for electronic sounds.</p>

<p>Rebillet’s rise to fame is attributed to his unique approach to music creation, which involves looping live music using a MIDI controller and keyboard, combined with his spontaneous lyrics that are often both humorous and provocatively sincere. His performances are characterized by a blend of electronic beats, vocal effects, and an engaging interaction with his audience, often solicited through live streams.</p>

<p>An alumnus of Southern Methodist University, Rebillet’s initial steps into the world of professional music didn&#8217;t follow a traditional path. Before his breakthrough on social media platforms like YouTube and Reddit, he experimented with various jobs, but ultimately his passion for music prevailed. Marc&#8217;s ability to engage with fans through raw, unedited performances that feature everything from soulful melodies to eccentric beats has garnered a dedicated following.</p>

                      <h3>The Art of Letting Go 2025 US-Canada Tour</h3>
                      <h4>w/ Tim Montana</h4>
                      <p><p>As a prolific songwriter, powerhouse vocalist, and proficient guitar player, <strong>Myles Kennedy</strong> tunes into the rhythm of his surroundings and goes with the flow. Fronting <strong>Alter Bridge</strong>, his soaring vocals, open-hearted lyrics, and airtight riffs have fueled the group’s global impact as a gold-certified, arena-filling force of nature over two decades-plus. On the microphone for <strong>Slash and The Conspirators</strong>, his towering range has consistently stunned audiences since 2010. Becoming a celebrated collaborator, he’s the rare presence just as comfortable on a track with <strong>Disturbed</strong>, <strong>Halestorm</strong>, and <strong>Sevendust</strong> as he is with <strong>Gov’t Mule</strong> and <strong>Darryl “DMC” McDaniels</strong>. It’s why he’s generated over 1 billion cumulative streams, earned gold and platinum certifications worldwide, uplifted countless fans, and <strong>KERRANG!</strong> christened him “one of rock’s finest vocalists.” It’s also why he’s carved out his own lane. 2021 saw him deliver his acclaimed sophomore opus, <em>The Ides of March</em>. It impressively notched a total of four #1 debuts across three countries, toppling the <strong>Billboard US Top Current Hard Music Chart</strong>, the <strong>UK Official Rock &amp; Metal Chart</strong> and <strong>Official Independent Album Chart</strong>, and <strong>Canada’s Hard Music Albums Chart</strong>. Beyond generating 10 million-plus streams, it incited unanimous critical applause from <strong>American Songwriter</strong>, <strong>Guitar.com</strong>, <strong>LoudWire</strong>, <strong>Guitar World</strong>, and more. <strong>RIFF</strong> hailed it as “a fantastic and must-listen record,” while <strong>Classic Rock Magazine</strong> awarded it “4.5-out-of-5 stars,” going on to attest, “The Ides of March confirms Myles Kennedy as a musical powerhouse.” With two solo efforts under his belt and sold out headline tours in the rearview, a sense of keenly honed intuition guides his third full-length LP, <em>The Art of Letting Go</em> [Napalm Records], led by the single “Say What You Will.”</p></p>

<p>Over the years, Travis has released several acclaimed albums, including, <em>12 Memories</em> (2003), <em>The Boy with No Name</em> (2007), and, <em>Where You Stand</em> (2013), showcasing their ability to evolve while maintaining their distinctive sound.

            <p>The Masonic Temple was opened with great ceremony on January 1, 1918. Owned by an independent corporation of Masons, the Temple was intended to house a disparate group of lodges and chapters; at one point, thirty-eight different groups called the temple home.</p>
            <p>Unlike the rest of the Temple, the Concert Hall was intended as rental public space to help defray operating costs, with dressing rooms, a stage, and food preparation areas.</p>
            <p>It’s been known by many names as music and owners changed: The Concert Hall; The Auditorium; Club 888; The Rockpile, Regency Ballroom. The Concert hall started out mainly being used as a lecture-hall (“<a href="images/posters/chesterton.png" class="popup">G. K. Chesterton: Literature as Luggage</a>”), ballroom (“<a href="images/posters/public-dancing.jpg" class="popup">Canada’s Largest Public Dance Every Wed. – Fri. – Sat.</a>”) and to host community concerts.</p>

          <div class="col-sm-3">
            <p>That’s not to say there weren’t more fantastic events too - Frank Sinatra used to rent the building for private parties, and the Rolling Stones used the space as a summer rehearsal studio for years.</p>
            <p>The Concert Hall started to gain traction as a rock concert venue in the 1960s, attracting performers like Wilson Pickett, Tina Turner, Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears, Johnny Lee Hooker, Canned Heat, and Buddy Guy by 1968.</p>
            <p>1969 was a massive year: <a href="images/posters/led-zeppelin2.jpg" class="popup">Led Zeppelin</a>, Muddy Waters, Frank Zappa, Chuck Berry, The Who, B. B. King, the Grateful Dead, Mothers of Invention. And that was just a lead into the 70s: The Animals, <a href="images/posters/iggy-pop2.jpg" class="popup">Iggy Pop</a>, <a href="images/posters/ramones.png" class="popup">The Ramones</a>, <a href="images/posters/toots.jpg" class="popup">Toots and the Maytals</a>, Hugh Masekela. The 80s starred Iron Maiden, <a href="images/posters/the-cure.png" class="popup">The Cure</a>, <a href="images/posters/dead-kennedys.jpg" class="popup">Dead Kennedys</a>, King Crimson and Depeche Mode</p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-sm-3">
            <p>But things were starting to look bleak. The Building’s condition had rapidly deteriorated throughout the 70s, and as Masons started moving to the suburbs, the Temple started to fall on hard times. The corporation started looking to sell in the mid 90s, but the bands played on, ranging from <a href="images/posters/vanilla-ice.png" class="popup">Vanilla Ice</a> to <a href="images/posters/weird-al.jpg" class="popup">Weird Al Yankovic</a>, <a href="images/posters/tragically-hip.png" class="popup">The Tragically Hip</a> to <a href="images/posters/ice-t.jpg" class="popup">Ice-T</a>. <a href="images/posters/rage-against-the-machine.png" class="popup">Rage Against the Machine</a>. Phish. <a href="images/posters/queen-latifah.png" class="popup">Queen Latifah</a>. David Bowie. <a href="images/posters/pearl-jam.png" class="popup">Pearl Jam</a> &amp; The Smashing Pumpkins opened for The Red Hot Chili Peppers. Green Day opened for Bad Religion. It wasn’t enough.</p>
            <p>The building narrowly escaped demolition in 1997 by being declared a heritage site (the ‘lucky’ 888 address was coveted by developers). CTV bought it in 1998 as a news bureau and venue for the Mike Bullard show. MTV took over in 2006, and, despite closing the Concert Hall, still managed to cage a performance from U2 in 2009.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-sm-3">
            <p>MTV decided to up-stakes and move down to Queen Street in 2012, but the Temple only had to wait a year before Info-Tech Research Group bought and thoroughly renovated it. The Concert Hall has been opened for special events, like listening sessions lead by Jimmy Page, concerts by Luke and the Apostles and Platinum Blond, boxing events, and much more. Now that 888 Yonge Inc. has the reins, we can expect more fantastic events in this beautiful, historic space.</p>
