      <p><strong>Watchhouse</strong> (formerly known as <strong>Mandolin Orange</strong>) is a folk duo that has redefined modern Americana with their introspective lyrics, lush harmonies, and masterful instrumentation. Comprising <strong>Andrew Marlin</strong> and <strong>Emily Frantz</strong>, the North Carolina-based musicians have spent over a decade crafting a sound that is both intimate and expansive, weaving together elements of folk, bluegrass, and indie rock.</p>
      <p>Since their debut, <strong>Watchhouse</strong> has built a reputation for creating music that resonates deeply with listeners, marked by poetic storytelling and a warmth that feels both familiar and fresh. Marlin’s rich songwriting—steeped in themes of love, change, and resilience—is complemented by Frantz’s stunning harmonies and multi-instrumental prowess. Their chemistry, both on stage and in the studio, has made them one of the most beloved acts in contemporary folk music.</p>
      <p>With albums like, <em>Tides of a Teardrop</em>, and their self-titled, <em>Watchhouse</em>, the duo has continually evolved while staying true to their roots. Their music, often described as both soothing and thought-provoking, has earned them critical acclaim and a devoted following.</p>
      <p>Whether performing in intimate theaters or on grand festival stages, <strong>Watchhouse</strong> delivers a mesmerizing live experience, drawing audiences into their world with delicate melodies and heartfelt performances. As they continue to grow and push the boundaries of folk music, <strong>Watchhouse</strong> remains a testament to the power of honest, unfiltered storytelling and the enduring magic of acoustic music.</p>
