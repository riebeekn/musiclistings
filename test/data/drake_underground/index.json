        "description": "Hailing from Omaha, Nebraska and based now in Nashville, Noah Floersch has been releasing smart and stirring pop music since his college years at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. When the single “Ghost of Chicago” from his second record Noah unexpectedly went viral, racking up millions of streams just about overnight, it allowed Floersch to quit his job at an ice prep factory and head out on his first major tours — including a support slot for Ricky Montgomery, and a headline tour at the end of last year. Now, taking on board the lessons he’s learned about connecting in a live setting, he debuts a new era with the sad-boy singalong anthem, “Growing Everything Out”. Inspired by the rougher side of his new on-the-road lifestyle, it’s a track about looking in the mirror, realizing you look like shit, and not even caring. Beneath its playful “na-na-na”s and its earworm melodies is a genuinely poignant mix of sadness and exhaustion, relatable to anyone who’s found themselves the worse for wear in a bathroom stall a few too many times. “Growing Everything Out” and the new music still to come sees Floersch grappling with his least flattering emotional impulses, at the same time as crafting the most undeniably fun songs of his career. It’s a combination of vulnerability and charisma that builds on the meaningful connection he’s already built with fans, and completes his transformation into a bona fide pop star."

With over 500 million streams and 140K Spotify followers, he’s built a global fanbase through deeply emotional music that explores love, pain, and self-reflection. Dropping out of high school at 16 to pursue music, he’s remained fully independent since 2017, steering his own path without a label. His viral hits like “Tonight” and collaborations with artists like Keshi and Kid Travis have solidified his status, recently culminating in a sold-out international tour in China."

He began producing music at 13 using YouTube tutorials and was collaborating with industry names by 15. Before turning 21, he had already written, produced, and recorded for major artists like Doja Cat, Big Sean, Kevin Abstract, and Tyga. In 2023, he released his debut EP Run, then joined global pop star Tate McRae on the North American leg of her Think Later Tour, where he dropped his breakout single “They Know I’m Bored” during a sold-out Madison Square Garden show. The buzz led to sold-out headliners in New York and L.A. and the release of Questions / Nightly, a two-pack featuring a remix with Ari Abdul. With millions of streams and undeniable momentum, Presley Regier is poised to become pop’s next breakout act. His highly anticipated new EP, SPILL, drops June 27, 2025."

Transplanted from Missouri to Chicago, Walker has a knack for getting to the “gooey heart” of relationships and experience, of bringing a city-dwelling life back down to earth. With an unadorned delivery and an unflinching eye, Walker relates songs about moving on, about growing up in the Midwest, and about loyalty to desperately flawed people and gratitude for pain, for the way things end up. &nbsp; Case Oats’ yet-to-be-announced debut album is a well-defined, inviting labor of love. Light on pastiche and heavy on intention, their arrangements, backed by a group of longtime collaborators, put Case Oats on a continuum of porch-sitting, familiar songwriters"

As a fully independent artist, Banshee writes, produces, and performs all of her work, building a fiercely devoted fanbase known as the Cult of Banshee—or to the diehards, the Stanshees."

With show-stopping delivery, dynamic range, and timeless panache, the Connecticut-born and raised entertainer immediately sets himself apart. If you’ve ever seen Michael live, you know the energy he brings is truly one of a kind. For Minelli, it’s all a matter of soul. “Soul is the core of everything,” he affirms. “It’s that thing you can’t put a finger on. Anytime somebody hears my music, I want them to immediately say, ‘That’s a Michael Minelli record.’” With over a decade of experience as an entertainer, Minelli has truly hit his stride—amassing over 200 million views across social media, more than 2 million followers, and over 30 million streams on his music. In 2024, he set the foundation with three support tours for Anees, Marc E. Bassy, and SonReal. Now in 2025, it’s time for Minelli to step into the spotlight as a headliner. One thing is for certain: this tour will be unlike anything he’s done before."

The two debuted with the single, “Hot Blooded,” an incomprehensibly magnetic voyage that offers warmth and compassion, and has now amassed over 45 million streams. Following a monumental year, Harlee and Josh continue to radiate their electrifying chemistry, now amplified by the addition of Kyle, a remarkable third member. With his exceptional musical prowess, Kyle infuses their live performances with a refreshing and captivating new energy. They are gearing themselves for an upcoming album release that can only be described as a continuation of their signature gilded alchemy."

Growing up on the Sunshine Coast, their sound was shaped by coastal life and close friendship, evolving from stripped-back acoustic sets to expansive, heart-swelling live performances. Their debut album Caught in a Reverie blends folk tradition with modern edge, offering moments of vulnerability, joy, and reflection. Known for the intimacy they create on stage and the honesty they bring to every song, The Dreggs continue to carve a space that feels both deeply personal and universally resonant."

It’s an expansive next step for the band, whose 2020 self-titled debut morphed from a few early cassette runs into several sold-out vinyl editions, unlikely name-drops from mega-stars, and several tours across the United States and Europe. From a long-overlooked pocket of Texas’ musical wealth, Teethe re-emerges with a deeply layered and collaborative work that makes the weight of the world feel a little lighter to lug"

        "description": "When Casey Lowery’s grandfather passed away in 2023, he left him a caravan on the English coast—far from the music industry chaos Casey had spent years trying to make sense of. There, living with his dog and surrounded by nature, Casey reconnected with his roots and finished lekkerland, his debut album named after an Afrikaans word meaning “something pleasing.” Raised in Chesterfield and inspired by early 2000s pop icons, Casey chased fame as a teen, scoring a viral hit with “Trampoline” and landing a record deal—only to realize the pop machine wasn’t for him. Dropped during the pandemic, he returned home and found unexpected success on TikTok, where his funny, diaristic songs earned him millions of fans and a global touring career. Working closely with producer Raffer, Casey built lekkerland as a deeply personal, self-directed project, shaped by friendship, grief, therapy, and real-life stories. Tracks like “Not Ready,” “Caroline,” “Blue Cords,” and “Blood Line” reflect his mix of vulnerability and wit. Now with over 5 million followers, four sold-out tours, and his own management company, Casey is creating a more grounded, inclusive version of the music world—one where he and his fans can be entirely themselves."

With millions of streams and a growing presence, he continues to carve his own lane. His 2024 EPs Afternoon Reflections and Another Round [Nettwerk Music Group] further showcase his artistry. Since his breakout Tide Pools EP in 2017, he has steadily built momentum, following up with The Sunshine Couch EP, which featured the standout “Mama’s Song.” In 2023, “Matcha” racked up over 1.5 million Spotify streams and earned praise from Glide Magazine and beyond. He carried that momentum into 2024 with Afternoon Reflections and the standout track “Oolong.” Now, splitting time between Chicago and LA, he’s fine-tuning his upcoming 2025 LP, continuing to push his sound forward."

        "description": "New Constellations &#8211; the ethereal brainchild of lifelong sidekicks Harlee Case and Josh Smith, and recent addition Kyle Farook &#8211; encapsulates a sonic dreamscape of eager melodies, striking guitar hooks, and celestial vocals that softly tangles listeners into a web of cosmic glory. &nbsp; The Portland-based duo first explored collaborating when they were 14, recording a song together in Josh’s childhood bedroom, before spending the next 15 years exploring their individual approaches to music separately and eventually crafting the dynamic perspective that would become New Constellations. The two debuted with the single, “Hot Blooded,” an incomprehensibly magnetic voyage that offers warmth and compassion, and has now amassed over 45 million streams. Following a monumental year, Harlee and Josh continue to radiate their electrifying chemistry, now amplified by the addition of Kyle, a remarkable third member. With his exceptional musical prowess, Kyle infuses their live performances with a refreshing and captivating new energy. They are gearing themselves for an upcoming album release that can only be described as a continuation of their signature gilded alchemy."

His unique blend of styles has established him as a significant figure in underground music culture. Full Crate’s influence has reached wider audiences, with Rihanna featuring his tracks in her Savage x Fenty lingerie shows on two occasions. His music has also been prominently featured in the Emmy-winning Netflix series When They See Us. With millions of streams under his belt—70 million for his track “A Storm On A Summers Day” and 12 million for his remix of Jungle’s “Back On 74”—Full Crate’s sound has resonated across various platforms. His work has also appeared in high-profile campaigns, including David Yurman’s advertisement featuring Michael B. Jordan. Looking ahead, Full Crate is set to continue his impressive trajectory after a successful debut album and a sold-out tour across North America. With headlining performances in major cities like Los Angeles, San Francisco, Chicago, and New York, he consistently showcases his evolution as both a multi-disciplinary performer and an innovator, crafting a soulful, genre-defying sound that resonates globally."

        "title": "Robyn Hitchcock (Day 1) - The Drake",
        "description": "Robyn Hitchcock is a legendary British singer-songwriter whose surrealist lyricism and genre-blurring catalog span six decades. A singular voice in music, his work is rich with recurring themes like marine life, obsolete electric transport, ghosts, cheese, and what one writer described as “morbid eroticism.” From fronting The Soft Boys’ psychedelic art-rock to crafting cult solo classics like I Often Dream of Trains and Eye, Hitchcock blends psychedelia, wit, and emotional depth with poetic ease. Now based in Nashville, he continues to evolve creatively—publishing books, releasing music through his own Tiny Ghost label, and collaborating across continents. With new songs set for release in 2025, Hitchcock remains an enduring icon of inventive rock. “I like to keep busy,” says Hitchcock. “We have all eternity to not exist.”"

        "title": "REMY BOND - The Drake",
        "description": "Remy Bond creates timeless pop anthems steeped in nostalgia and cinematic allure. Blending vintage aesthetics with contemporary lyricism, her music invites listeners into a world where the golden age of Hollywood meets modern-day sensibilities. Her breakout single, &#8220;Summer Song,&#8221; launched her into the spotlight, amassing over 12 million streams and securing radio airplay. The track&#8217;s extreme success on TikTok propelled it to #2 on the Viral 50 USA Spotify charts before finally landing her the prestigious #1 spot on Spotify’s Fresh Finds Class of 2024. Building on this momentum, Remy would release standout singles “Don’t Go Back to Paris” and “Star Shaped Baby”, two beautiful songs infused with a sense of nostalgia and endless yearning. Along with their iconic music videos, these tracks would allow the rising artist to develop a deeply personalized aesthetic atmosphere that early fans resonated with and later took part in re-imagining through social media. Early on, Remy’s emphasis on visual artistry would distinguish her work as truly unique. Her music videos, often directed by her talented 18-year-old sister Olivia Bond, showcase her larger-than-life creative vision. Fans feel at home in the Remy Bond cinematic universe, one characterized by a sense of blissful extravagance. Remy&#8217;s historic debut show at The Roxy in Los Angeles was a sold-out affair, with over a thousand fans crowding the sidewalk for a chance to witness her leadoff performance. She continually brings an aura of lavishness to her stages, which she fills with burlesque dancers, giant martini glasses, and 6-feet-tall wedding cakes that she emerges from. Her most recent song Simple Girl has been breaking the internet. The track meshes rhythmic and melodic elements inspired by ABBA’s music with modern Synth and Bedroom Pop characteristics. The lyrics are witty and playful, as Remy hits notes no one even knew were possible to sing when delivering them. Recently, Remy’s music made major appearances on Amazon Music’s 2025 Indie Artist to Watch list, Zane Lowe’s 25 for ‘25 list for Apple Music, and InStyle’s 2025 Musicians to Watch list. This precedes the 19-year old rising star’s signing with Warner Records and Sony/ATV Publishing, a huge step in her career that will allow her to raise the ceiling even higher on what she can achieve Needless to say, no one can wait to see what Remy has in store for us in this new year. Her US nationwide and Europe tours that will spark off the release of her upcoming album are generating immense levels of hype across the music industry. There’s no doubt we’re due for a Remy Bond takeover in 202"

His debut album Motorcycle Sound Effects is a genre-blurring exploration of first love, heartbreak, self-doubt, and fleeting moments—like dancing barefoot at sunset or driving aimlessly with friends. A former dancer turned musician, the 24-year-old Vancouver native has earned a Juno nomination and toured internationally, crafting songs that feel both fresh and timeless. Produced by David Marinelli, the album is a coming-of-age soundtrack full of energy, honesty, and heart."

        "description": "Johnny Manchild and the Poor Bastards is an American multi-genre ensemble founded by Johnny Manchild.Since its founding in 2016, the band took the internet by storm, with a unique conundrum of jazz idioms, grunge, alt-rock, world music, and funk that prompted even Anthony Fantano himself (known as “The Only Music Critic Who Matters” by the NYT) ask “what gives them the right to be this good? ” The Bastards have since answered that question, drawing from a dedicated and thriving fanbase that is bound together by a deep love of music, lyricism, engineering and sonic exploration. From their hometown of Oklahoma City to the global stage, each release has been a marked discovery not just for the fans, but the Poor Bastards themselves. With 18+ million streams, 4 albums, and new sonic horizons to be crossed, the Poor Bastards have morphed into a collective of sorts with as many as 10 collaborators (affectionately “Bastards”) in regular rotation, with Johnny Manchild at the helm.

        "description": "Ryan Ellis is a GRAMMY-nominated, Dove Award-winning singer-songwriter whose music blends worship, R&amp;B, and hip hop to foster unity and spread the love of Jesus. Known for his Billboard charting hits &#8220;I Thank God&#8221; and &#8220;Heart of the Father,&#8221; Ellis’s latest album Real Love explores themes of empathy, personal struggle, and faith, with a focus on reaching overlooked communities. Raised in a military family with Filipino roots, Ellis’s perspective is shaped by diverse experiences, including his time in the Navy and personal loss. His honest lyrics, paired with upbeat melodies, reflect his desire to connect people through shared experiences of grief, love, and healing. With a heart for collaboration, Ellis has worked with artists like Chris Tomlin and Maverick City Music, and his viral hit “Better Days” resonates deeply with fans facing their own challenges. Through Real Love, Ellis aims to create a soundtrack of hope, offering a message of unity and the transformative power of God’s love."

A bold follow-up to 2022’s On the Ranch, Drive &amp; Cry finds Nenni firmly rooted in her Nashville world, drawing inspiration from dive bars like Santa’s Pub and channeling personal experiences into every track. With help from producer John James Tourville and a circle of close friends, she crafted a record that is unfiltered, empowering, and entirely her own—proof that she was always meant to take center stage."
