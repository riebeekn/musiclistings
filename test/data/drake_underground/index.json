    "fm_copy_one": "\u003Cp\u003ECRIMEAPPLE, a relatively unknown rapper from Hackensack, New Jersey, delivered a weapons-grade freestyle that announced his arrival as a major talent. Despite not hailing from a traditional hip-hop hotspot, CRIMEAPPLE's early exposure to rap through his older brothers and his relentless drive to create and perform has led to a series of acclaimed projects and collaborations with prominent producers like Buck Dudley and DJ Muggs, all while maintaining his independence in the music industry.\u003C/p\u003E\n",
    "fm_copy_two": "",
    "fm_copy_detail": "\u003Cp\u003EIn the Spring of 2017, on Statik Selektah’s Show-Off radio show, a relatively unknown rapper by the name of CRIMEAPPLE stepped up to the mic and kicked out the kind of weapons-grade freestyle that heralds the arrival of a major talent. Even more remarkable was the fact that he wasn’t from Queens, or Oakland, or Brooklyn, or Atlanta, or any of the other cities that have been hip-hop hotspots since the birth of the genre. No, CRIMEAPPLE was from the suburban town of Hackensack, New Jersey. Which meant that if he was going to make a name for himself, he was going to have to make connections in the city.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ECRIME was introduced to hip-hop early—his two older brothers would play rap records in the house before he even started elementary school. “I was fortunate enough to have a lot of hip-hop in my household when I was young,” he says. “I think I started rapping just by hearing songs and rapping them to myself at a very young age—and maybe forgetting the words and changing them.” When he was eight years old, CRIME was already writing and recording original songs. “I was mad young, with the li’l speakers and the tape shit—writing li’l crazy rhymes in, like, third grade. I always had a pen and the proclivity to create.”\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn high school, CRIME earned a reputation for his skills on the mic, which served him well on the local battle rap circuit. “This was actually old school battling where it’s like, you’re nice, and everyone knows you’re nice. So, people from the other town hear about this kid from the other high school who is killing everybody, and y’all are gonna meet up [and battle],” he says.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIt wasn’t long after that when CRIME met producer Buck Dudley, who has since become his most frequent collaborator. “I met CRIME at a show in New Brunswick about 9 or 10 years ago,” Dudley recalls. “We had a mutual friend who introduced us, and we collabed on a few songs soon after that. We kept working on a few different projects over the years, and both took time off from making music in that time period but remained close.” After CRIME’s stunning performance on Statik Selektah’s show in 2017, the duo decided they needed to capitalize on the buzz and get some music in the streets.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhich is how CRIME’s classic debut Metralleta was born. The 7-song EP is a showcase for his biting humor and oddball references, which he spits over Buck’s dark, ominous grooves. There’s no one standout track—every song is a highlight. Even after a cursory listen, CRIME’s fondness for unlikely word choice is apparent. On “Milk and Ladyfingers,” he nonchalantly drops “hoot” and “chortled” in the same line. On “The Cookout” and “Popshit,” he waxes nostalgic, reliving a world of lively Colombian BBQs and somber father/son smoke sessions.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWithin a month and a half of Metralleta’s release, CRIME and Buck dropped three more EPs: Perfect, Perfect 2, and Sweet Dreams. In the summer of 2018, he released Aguardiente, a full-length collaboration with enigmatic producer Big Ghost Ltd. The album, which takes its name from a strong Colombian liquor, is the perfect pairing; Ghost’s woozy beats are an ideal match for the New Jersey lyricist’s slow flow. The album was not only a favorite with fans but it was on DJ Muggs’ Top 5 Albums of 2018 list, which turned out to be foreshadowing for what was to come.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAt the top of 2019, CRIME teamed up with Brooklyn/L.A. producer DJ Skizz (who has worked with Your Ol’ Droog, Sean Price, and Conway) for their collab album Wet Dirt. Opening with a song that re-contextualizes the first stanza of “My Favorite Things” from The Sound of Music, the album expands on CRIME’s work up to that point. “Divine” is marked by deeply personal confessions: “Regretting what a couple dates made/ Staring at a life sentence ‘cause her period came late/ And how would I confess like, your daddy was a bastard/ Who didn’t wear protection and now you’re part of that pattern/ Momma never got a ring and could barely afford a Saturn/ I never got the chance, so all I can do is imagine.” And on “FFFeel Good,” CRIME indulges his vocabulary fetish by flipping words that start almost exclusively with the letter “F”: “Fumes fogging up my frontal lobe/ I feel frozen/ Fickle 5-0 flooded, fled the fuzz, fuck it/ Front forever but the flow is irrefutable/ Inflammable, fresh flowers furnished the funeral.”\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ELater that same year, CRIME added another high-profile collaborator to his CV: Cypress Hill’s DJ Muggs, his partner on Medallo. To give the project an extra layer of authenticity CRIME, who is Colombian, brought Muggs to Medellín—where his family is originally from—to record. “I had been to Colombia several times in my life,” CRIME says. “But before that trip, I hadn’t been in like 12 years. It was a big deal. Getting to do an album with Muggs, let alone just kicking it with him on a regular basis was incredible. And kinda reacquainting myself with where my family’s from, remembering shit and being able to show him places, try the cuisine, all that good stuff—it was a fire experience.”\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ECRIME recently reconnected with Buck to begin work on their sixth project together, Viridi Panem. The title roughly translates to mean “green bread,” and the album is a study of capitalist greed. References to the shiny-suit era of Bad Boy Records, as well as “D’Angelo Vickers,” a song named after Will Ferrell’s money-grubbing character from The Office, help sell the concept. Buck’s beats fall somewhere between spooky and sinister, which perfectly suit CRIME’s rhymes, which detail his expensive tastes and what he’s willing to do to enjoy them. (“Dead Gringos,” for example, is a menacing ode to “stacking up dead white dudes”—aka, money.)\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd while labels have been circling the MC, CRIME is content to stay independent. “Cats know I get busy regardless, whether I’m signed or not,” he says. “Everyone knows I don’t run with no crew. I just get busy and make it happen.”\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n",

Her dynamic voice belies a gentle girl-next-door charm and razor-sharp songwriting instincts, making her brand of pop as clever as it is catchy. After quietly generating over 100 million streams and earning acclaim from FLAUNT and Melodic Magazine, she invites you to listen in on this conversation via her 2024 full-length debut, Big Mouth.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E“Each song is meant to feel like hot goss I’m sharing with a close friend” she affirms. “This album is me opening my ‘big mouth’ and not holding anything back. I want you to feel like I’m finally saying that thing you’ve been biting your tongue about.”\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EGrowing up in New Jersey, the half-Japanese songstress realized her purpose at seven years old when she told her mom she wanted to be a singer. She honed her talents in musical theater, auditioning for productions in New York City on a weekly basis. She and her sisters belted along to the likes of Sheryl Crow in the car with dad. Discovering Taylor Swift at the age of thirteen, she picked up a guitar and focused on songwriting. Following a creative path, she graduated from Elon University with a major in Music Production and minor in film and graphic design. Moving to Music City, she worked as a video editor at Warner Music Nashville by day, and she created her own music at night and on weekends.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBrooke initially gained traction with projects such as Me EP [2019], It’s Not You EP [2020], and I Don’t Take Pictures Anymore EP [2022]. However, she made viral waves with “All My Exes’ Moms.” It lit up TikTok, generated 25 million Spotify streams, and paved the way for her Look My Age EP [2023]. FLAUNT christened her “a breath of fresh air in the music industry,” while she graced the stage of Lollapalooza and canvased the country on tour with Lostboycrow. Other artists Brooke has opened for include Yung Gravy, Jake Miller, Haley Reinhart, Nicotine Dolls, and Arrows In Action.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThroughout 2023, she assembled what would become Big Mouth. Helming the vision, she handpicked the driving stories, and then conceptualized and creative-directed the videos and designated aesthetic. Sonically, she leaned into turn-of-the-century pop punk and alternative in addition to finding storytelling inspiration in the likes of Maisie Peters and Olivia Rodrigo. She kicked off the album with a Spotify New Music Friday placement for “Never Liked Your Name.”\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EEmphasizing representation, she enlisted a team of Asian creatives to “be a part of every aspect of the song,” including an Asian mixer, mastering engineer, and photographer. She then followed it up with undeniable ear worms like “Move To LA (I Don’t Wanna),” “Seriously,” and “Girlfriend.”\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EShe pulls no punches on the next single, “Hot Like You.” On the track, melodic guitar winces beneath a rock-solid beat. The momentum builds as a chantable chorus takes hold, “I’m getting sick of being cute, I wanna be hot like you.”\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E“I wrote it about how my sisters are hotter than me,” she laughs. “In the writing session, I was joking that I’m pretty, but there are girls who are just undeniable tens. Everyone wants to feel invincible like that. It’s meant to hype up girls too.”\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EElsewhere, she makes another confession during “Younger Guys.” A thick bassline thumps beneath her vocals, and a palm-muted riff propels the sunny refrain, “I like guys when they’re younger, mess around for the summer, not my fault that they’re funner.”\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E“It’s a summer vibe,” she notes. “I always end up dating boys who are younger than me by a few years. They tend to not take things as seriously and bring out my fun side, which is kind of refreshing for me. Maybe ‘age is just a number’ after all.”\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EHandclaps kickstart “Break Up On Vacation,” and she sets the scene, “A few days just us all alone, but it didn’t go like I hoped. I learned some things I wish I still didn’t know.”\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E“Coincidentally, I’ve broken up with a couple of guys on trips.” She goes on, “When you’re on vacation, you really find out if you’re compatible or not. If I decide I’m not into someone anymore, I’m not going to drag it out until we’re back home. I can’t fake it,” she laughs.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThen, there’s “Super Famous.” As bold guitar fades in and out of focus, she boasts, “I’m filling your camera roll, see my face soon as you open your phone, me and your mom are real close, she always brings me up when you call home.”\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E“For me, it sets the stage for the whole album,” she says. “This song is a warning for anyone who breaks my heart – that you’ll hear about me and see my face everywhere you go! The songs that follow are the byproduct of that inevitable ending. I’ve always had a feat that I can’t find love and have my dream career at the same time. If somebody breaks up with me, my song goes viral the next night. If my single doesn’t stream well, I’ll get asked on a date. And that fear is the underbelly of the whole record.”\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EShe caps off Big Mouth with the finale “First Time.” Soft acoustic guitar creaks beneath her expressive vocals, “Now I believe in lightning strikes, all ‘cause I felt it the first time.”\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E“I wanted to close the record on an inspirational note,” she adds. “Even though we didn’t work out, you showed me that love does exist and is out there for me to find again.”\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBy the time it’s over, Brooke may just be your new BFF.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E“When you listen to these songs, I hope you feel less alone,” she leaves off. “Whether you’re jamming in your car or crying in your bedroom - know that I’ve felt that too.”\u003C/p\u003E\n",

The result is colourful shining pieces that come alive and cast beautiful reflections across rooms. \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFor me, stained glass is a response to the monotonous greyscale of our urban environment and to my own personal history. After experiencing domestic violence as a teenager and working decades in the field of domestic violence prevention, overcoming a life-threatening rare disease called Pheochromocytoma, and experiencing the stress and isolation of the pandemic, I found myself searching for a creative antidote to all of this heaviness. I found it in stained glass, a medium that allows me to bring more colour, light, joy and vibrancy to others, and to my own life. I’ve fallen deeply in love with glass and enjoy getting lost in the process. Each stage takes time, patience, and precision -- from sketching a design, choosing the glass, cutting the pieces, grinding the edges, wrapping each piece in copper foil, soldering the pieces together, and waxing the finished piece so it shines brightly. \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ECreating these pieces brings a sense of calm to my body and mind, grounding me.

This deliberate play with color effects becomes a central theme, encouraging observers to introspectively navigate their own emotional and physical reactions to each piece. In \"Gamma Waves,\" these color dynamics are enhanced by the incorporation of swirling patterns inspired by the brain's gamma wave activity, associated with moments of insight and heightened cognitive processing. By embedding these patterns into the artwork, the exhibition aims to engage viewers in a deeper cognitive and emotional experience, mirroring the brain's state during profound realizations.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe surreality of colour and the contemplative expressions of the characters are used to push and pull the viewer. Often caught in an unwavering stare, the figures intend to create an experience where the viewer is captivated by the sensation of being seen. This intimate and sometimes discomfiting interaction is further amplified by the hypnotic, swirling patterns, drawing viewers into a trance-like state where they can explore their own consciousness and emotions. \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EMorgan Booth is an established Pop Figurative artist based in Toronto, Canada. Her signature blue figure oil paintings use surreal color choices and figures to explore concepts of identity and discovery of self. Playing with the perceptual experience and physical response to colour, Booth uses blue tones to evoke feelings of calmness and contemplation, while using the intensity of warm colors as an emotional contrast.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAdd your energy to the creative process as innovative artists from multiple disciplines showcase and discuss their work in the cozy confines of the lobby-turned-studio space.\u003C/p\u003E\n",

    "fm_copy_detail": "\u003Cp\u003EI Keep My Feet on the Fragile Plane” – Allegra Krieger’s fourth record and her first with Double Double Whammy – is her most mature and alluring work yet. It contains all the signatures of her best lyricism: delicate and precise phrasings, moments that flicker between beauty and banality, meaning that forms through the accretion of observations, memories, and unexpected adages. This is an album that is at once post-theistic and devoted to a relationship with the divine, each song blinking in and out of “the fragile plane,” a place Krieger describes as “a middle ground in the universe,” both abstract and peaceful, where time, bodies, and names don’t exist.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EKrieger’s peripateticism has clearly informed her songwriting. She spent her childhood on the blistering beaches and cold Catholic pews of northern Florida. Before settling in Chinatown, she drifted through suburban Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Portugal, Italy, and Ireland cleaning motel rooms, planting trees, tending bars, and picking olives. In “Terribly Free”, she walks with the rats in Manhattan; in “I Wanted to Be” she bites into a ripe orange somewhere in the south; in “Nothing in This World Ever Stays Still” she stands outside of a sports bar in LA watching coastal smoke rise from the hills; later, she describes being “moved by whatever’s moving us.”\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIt’s with an almost deadly self-awareness that Krieger assembles a world in which people and places leave as quickly and easily as they arrive. “I never forgot,” she tells us in “I Wanted to Be,” “that as something grows something else must rot.” Yet Krieger doesn’t linger too long in honest exhaustion. Soon, she’s drinking coffee and watching a child dance across the street. Later “a brief but brilliant sun touches the hills” and she takes on the child’s inclinations, telling us, “if you feel like dancing, you must let it out, no room for question, no room for doubt.”\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EKrieger initially collaborated with Luke Temple and Jeremy Harris to record her vocals and guitar to tape at Panoramic Studios in West Marin, CA. As the album continued to form, Krieger envisioned instruments – like the French and English horn (Nancy Ranger and Priscilla Reinhart), electric guitar (Jacob Drab), and pedal steel (Kevin Copeland) – as characters which would walk in and out of the soundscape. What emerged from conversations with composer Sammy Weissberg, are brass parts that have a dark, almost surreal logic: horns arise to emphasize a word or phrase, fall out completely, only to rush back with dissonant orchestrations that gesture simultaneously toward deterioration and generation. Krieger herself plays pedal steel on “I Wanted to Be,” a song which was finished at Science is Magic Studios, and takes the form of an ouroboros: the chorus feeds into itself in a seemingly endless cycle before colliding into a rising clash of Krieger’s pedal steel and Drab’s electric guitar. While Krieger takes inspiration from Elliot Smith’s honesty, Judee Sill’s cosmic reaching, and Joni Mitchell’s sharp noticing, the dream-like association, harmonic dissonance, and angular melodic ascensions in each song are singularly and delightfully Krieger’s.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E“I Keep My Feet on the Fragile Plane” is a daring collection of songs by an artist who scries with both the cold glass eye of truth and the beating heart of empathy; who portrays life in all its twisted complexities and in turn makes the felt and invisible, visible.\u003C/p\u003E\n",

Now, two years later, the bilingual singer/songwriter is formally introducing herself with her stunning full-length debut, Multitudes. Recorded with co-producers Tyler Chester and Daniel Radin, the album is a bold, captivating self-portrait, one that serves not only as a testament to how far Amador has come (she’s earned dates with everyone from Hozier and Brandi Carlile to Lake Street Dive and Maggie Rogers) but also as a celebration of where she comes from (her roots span Puerto Rico, New Mexico, Argentina, and New England). Slipping effortlessly between Spanish and English and featuring appearances from Gaby Moreno, Madison Cunningham, and Quinn Christopherson, the collection is raw and vulnerable, at once steeped in devastating loss and uncertainty, but also laced with the hope and resilience of a young woman learning to find her voice and stand her ground. Certainly, Multitudes is a beautiful record—the way Amador’s crystalline voice cuts through the album’s lush synthesizers, dreamy guitars, and cinematic string arrangements is nothing short of spellbinding—but more than that, it’s a fierce work of discovery and affirmation, a profound, revelatory meditation on triumph and loss, endings and beginnings, identity and belonging.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe day Alisa Amador decided to walk away from her career in music was, ironically enough, the day her career truly began.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E“I was burned out and dealing with all this personal grief and trauma, and I finally just came to the conclusion that I couldn’t go on the way I was anymore,” she reflects. “And then as I was walking through the logistics of how I would break the news to everyone in my life, I got a phone call telling me that I’d won the NPR Tiny Desk Contest.”\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ENow, two years later, Amador is an artist reborn, both spiritually and sonically, with a stunning full-length debut to show for it. Recorded with co-producers Tyler Chester and Daniel Radin, Multitudes finds the bilingual singer/songwriter formally introducing herself with a bold, captivating self-portrait, one that serves not only as a testament to how far she’s come, but also as a celebration of where she comes from. Slipping effortlessly between Spanish and English and featuring guest appearances from Gaby Moreno, Madison Cunningham, and Quinn Christopherson, the songs here are raw and vulnerable, at once steeped in devastating loss and uncertainty, but also laced with the hope and resilience of young woman learning to find her voice and stand her ground in the midst of a personal and professional maelstrom. Certainly, Multitudes is a beautiful record—the way Amador’s crystalline voice cut through the album’s lush synthesizers, dreamy guitars, and cinematic string arrangements is nothing short of spellbinding—but more than that, it’s a fierce work of discovery and affirmation that reveals new secrets with each repeated listen, a profound, revelatory meditation on triumph and loss, endings and beginnings, identity and belonging, all delivered by a songwriter convinced she would never write again.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E“When NPR called, I genuinely considered asking them to give the honor to someone else,” Amador recalls. “I felt like a fraud because after the death of a close friend in 2020, I’d completely stopped writing. But in that moment, it felt like something was telling me to surrender to the reality that music is and always would be my purpose.”\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAmador’s passion for music is no coincidence. Born to a pair of Latin folk artists, she began singing with her parents’ band, Sol Y Canto, at the age of five, and spent much of her childhood traveling the country on an endless series of tours along with her twin brother, Zia. She spent extended periods with her grandparents in Puerto Rico and New Mexico, as well, before attending college in Maine, which enabled her to study abroad in Buenos Aires for a semester.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E“From a young age, I saw exactly how insane and difficult it was to make a life playing music,” Amador recalls. “But I also knew I’d be lying to myself if I tried to do anything else.”\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFresh out of school, Amador began touring and recording as a solo artist, releasing a pair of well-received independent EPs and crisscrossing the country just as she had during her childhood. But over time, something about her experiences began to feel off, and the purpose and meaning she’d found in music began slipping through her fingers.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E“Looking back on it now, I realize that I was just trying to be who I thought other people wanted me to be,” Amador explains. “I was saying ‘yes’ to everything and working so hard to not make other people uncomfortable that I couldn’t hear myself think. I lost touch with what I wanted, and suddenly this thing that had been so rewarding and so healing was putting me in situations that made me feel unsafe and disrespected as a Latina woman.”\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen she got word from NPR that she’d taken top prize in the prestigious Tiny Desk Contest, Amador decided that the only way she could accept the honor and carry on professionally was with a complete and total reset.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E“I realized that if this was going to work, I was going to have to really start listening to myself and advocating for myself and making other people uncomfortable,” she explains. “I was going to have to start respecting my boundaries and saying ‘no’ more than ‘yes.’”\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EStanding on the precipice of letting it all go had made Amador fearless. What could they take away from her, after all, that she wasn’t already willing to walk away from herself? And so she headed to DC, taping an arresting set for the Tiny Desk Concert series that had NPR’s Bob Boilen hailing her as a “powerful voice whose tender performance commands attention and fosters connection” and Cyrena Touros calling her “a pitch-perfect rendition of my wildest dreams.” In the year that followed, Amador would go on to land dates with everyone from Hozier and Brandi Carlile to Lake Street Dive and Hiss Golden Messenger, but first, she headed west to Los Angeles, where she cut the foundation of Multitudes live in the studio.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E“I wanted the 100% realness that comes with live performances, but I also wanted to take the music to another level,” says Amador, who brought the recordings back home to Boston for overdubs and extensive production work. “My roots are in Argentina and Puerto Rico and New Mexico, so magical realism has always been a part of my culture and my writing. I wanted to create a sound that could transport you, that could move you through time and space.”\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThat immersive sense of magical realism is palpable from the outset on Multitudes, which opens with the exquisite “Extraño.” Tender and aching, the track (which features a guest appearance by Gaby Moreno) showcases Amador’s enthralling vocals atop a spare acoustic guitar as she navigates the liminal space between cultures and reckons with 'the perpetual outsider status she’s faced for most of her life.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E“In Spanish, the word ‘extraño’ can mean ‘strange,’ but it can also mean ‘I miss,’” Amador explains. “When you’re the daughter of immigrants, it’s easy to feel like the strange one, like you’re always missing something. I’ve struggled to hold on to my native language, and sometimes when you feel it slipping away, it triggers this sense of existential loss, like you don’t really belong anywhere.”\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAmador wrestles with the notion of belonging throughout the record, blurring the lines between languages and genres in a reflection of her own personal search for self. The driving indie-rocker “Love Hate Song” grapples with a life full of catch-22s, while the lilting “Nudo de raíces” looks for the beauty in the in between, and the hypnotic “Woke Up Today” offers a heavenly dose of chamber folk as it finally lets its guard down.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E“‘Woke Up Today’ is the song that helped me realize that the things that I’m most afraid to say are the things that are the most important for me to say,” Amador explains. “It’s the first time I’m openly singing about my experiences with depression, and I just hope it makes people feel less alone or crazy or wrong, that it helps them feel okay exactly as they are.”\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ELearning to hold that kind of compassion is at the core of Multitudes. The soaring “Heartless Author” (written with Amador’s brother, Zia, and featuring Madison Cunningham on vocals) makes peace with the unknown in an effort to be kinder to the face in the mirror; the hushed “A Million Ways” revels in the simple joy of truly being seen and loved by another; and the tenacious “I Need To Believe” (featuring past Tiny Desk Contest winner Quinn Chistopherson) refuses to give up, even when hope seems impossible to grasp. But it’s perhaps the songs Amador wrote for her late friend—the graceful “Pasajeras,” which extends a helping hand in a time of struggle, and the buoyant “Enough,” which makes room for grief in everyday life—that are most affecting, not only for the poignancy with which Amador delivers them, but for the fact that she was able to deliver them at all.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E“After you lose someone, you can get this sense that nothing will ever be enough,” she reflects. “In grieving my friend, I went through a period where I couldn’t write or even pick up an instrument at all, but now I sing these songs to her every night.

Now, two years later, the bilingual singer/songwriter is formally introducing herself with her stunning full-length debut, Multitudes. Recorded with co-producers Tyler Chester and Daniel Radin, the album is a bold, captivating self-portrait, one that serves not only as a testament to how far Amador has come (she’s earned dates with everyone from Hozier and Brandi Carlile to Lake Street Dive and Maggie Rogers) but also as a celebration of where she comes from (her roots span Puerto Rico, New Mexico, Argentina, and New England). Slipping effortlessly between Spanish and English and featuring appearances from Gaby Moreno, Madison Cunningham, and Quinn Christopherson, the collection is raw and vulnerable, at once steeped in devastating loss and uncertainty, but also laced with the hope and resilience of a young woman learning to find her voice and stand her ground. Certainly, Multitudes is a beautiful record—the way Amador’s crystalline voice cuts through the album’s lush synthesizers, dreamy guitars, and cinematic string arrangements is nothing short of spellbinding—but more than that, it’s a fierce work of discovery and affirmation, a profound, revelatory meditation on triumph and loss, endings and beginnings, identity and belonging.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe day Alisa Amador decided to walk away from her career in music was, ironically enough, the day her career truly began.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E“I was burned out and dealing with all this personal grief and trauma, and I finally just came to the conclusion that I couldn’t go on the way I was anymore,” she reflects. “And then as I was walking through the logistics of how I would break the news to everyone in my life, I got a phone call telling me that I’d won the NPR Tiny Desk Contest.”\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ENow, two years later, Amador is an artist reborn, both spiritually and sonically, with a stunning full-length debut to show for it. Recorded with co-producers Tyler Chester and Daniel Radin, Multitudes finds the bilingual singer/songwriter formally introducing herself with a bold, captivating self-portrait, one that serves not only as a testament to how far she’s come, but also as a celebration of where she comes from. Slipping effortlessly between Spanish and English and featuring guest appearances from Gaby Moreno, Madison Cunningham, and Quinn Christopherson, the songs here are raw and vulnerable, at once steeped in devastating loss and uncertainty, but also laced with the hope and resilience of young woman learning to find her voice and stand her ground in the midst of a personal and professional maelstrom. Certainly, Multitudes is a beautiful record—the way Amador’s crystalline voice cut through the album’s lush synthesizers, dreamy guitars, and cinematic string arrangements is nothing short of spellbinding—but more than that, it’s a fierce work of discovery and affirmation that reveals new secrets with each repeated listen, a profound, revelatory meditation on triumph and loss, endings and beginnings, identity and belonging, all delivered by a songwriter convinced she would never write again.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E“When NPR called, I genuinely considered asking them to give the honor to someone else,” Amador recalls. “I felt like a fraud because after the death of a close friend in 2020, I’d completely stopped writing. But in that moment, it felt like something was telling me to surrender to the reality that music is and always would be my purpose.”\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAmador’s passion for music is no coincidence. Born to a pair of Latin folk artists, she began singing with her parents’ band, Sol Y Canto, at the age of five, and spent much of her childhood traveling the country on an endless series of tours along with her twin brother, Zia. She spent extended periods with her grandparents in Puerto Rico and New Mexico, as well, before attending college in Maine, which enabled her to study abroad in Buenos Aires for a semester.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E“From a young age, I saw exactly how insane and difficult it was to make a life playing music,” Amador recalls. “But I also knew I’d be lying to myself if I tried to do anything else.”\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFresh out of school, Amador began touring and recording as a solo artist, releasing a pair of well-received independent EPs and crisscrossing the country just as she had during her childhood. But over time, something about her experiences began to feel off, and the purpose and meaning she’d found in music began slipping through her fingers.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E“Looking back on it now, I realize that I was just trying to be who I thought other people wanted me to be,” Amador explains. “I was saying ‘yes’ to everything and working so hard to not make other people uncomfortable that I couldn’t hear myself think. I lost touch with what I wanted, and suddenly this thing that had been so rewarding and so healing was putting me in situations that made me feel unsafe and disrespected as a Latina woman.”\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen she got word from NPR that she’d taken top prize in the prestigious Tiny Desk Contest, Amador decided that the only way she could accept the honor and carry on professionally was with a complete and total reset.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E“I realized that if this was going to work, I was going to have to really start listening to myself and advocating for myself and making other people uncomfortable,” she explains. “I was going to have to start respecting my boundaries and saying ‘no’ more than ‘yes.’”\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EStanding on the precipice of letting it all go had made Amador fearless. What could they take away from her, after all, that she wasn’t already willing to walk away from herself? And so she headed to DC, taping an arresting set for the Tiny Desk Concert series that had NPR’s Bob Boilen hailing her as a “powerful voice whose tender performance commands attention and fosters connection” and Cyrena Touros calling her “a pitch-perfect rendition of my wildest dreams.” In the year that followed, Amador would go on to land dates with everyone from Hozier and Brandi Carlile to Lake Street Dive and Hiss Golden Messenger, but first, she headed west to Los Angeles, where she cut the foundation of Multitudes live in the studio.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E“I wanted the 100% realness that comes with live performances, but I also wanted to take the music to another level,” says Amador, who brought the recordings back home to Boston for overdubs and extensive production work. “My roots are in Argentina and Puerto Rico and New Mexico, so magical realism has always been a part of my culture and my writing. I wanted to create a sound that could transport you, that could move you through time and space.”\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThat immersive sense of magical realism is palpable from the outset on Multitudes, which opens with the exquisite “Extraño.” Tender and aching, the track (which features a guest appearance by Gaby Moreno) showcases Amador’s enthralling vocals atop a spare acoustic guitar as she navigates the liminal space between cultures and reckons with 'the perpetual outsider status she’s faced for most of her life.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E“In Spanish, the word ‘extraño’ can mean ‘strange,’ but it can also mean ‘I miss,’” Amador explains. “When you’re the daughter of immigrants, it’s easy to feel like the strange one, like you’re always missing something. I’ve struggled to hold on to my native language, and sometimes when you feel it slipping away, it triggers this sense of existential loss, like you don’t really belong anywhere.”\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAmador wrestles with the notion of belonging throughout the record, blurring the lines between languages and genres in a reflection of her own personal search for self. The driving indie-rocker “Love Hate Song” grapples with a life full of catch-22s, while the lilting “Nudo de raíces” looks for the beauty in the in between, and the hypnotic “Woke Up Today” offers a heavenly dose of chamber folk as it finally lets its guard down.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E“‘Woke Up Today’ is the song that helped me realize that the things that I’m most afraid to say are the things that are the most important for me to say,” Amador explains. “It’s the first time I’m openly singing about my experiences with depression, and I just hope it makes people feel less alone or crazy or wrong, that it helps them feel okay exactly as they are.”\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ELearning to hold that kind of compassion is at the core of Multitudes. The soaring “Heartless Author” (written with Amador’s brother, Zia, and featuring Madison Cunningham on vocals) makes peace with the unknown in an effort to be kinder to the face in the mirror; the hushed “A Million Ways” revels in the simple joy of truly being seen and loved by another; and the tenacious “I Need To Believe” (featuring past Tiny Desk Contest winner Quinn Chistopherson) refuses to give up, even when hope seems impossible to grasp. But it’s perhaps the songs Amador wrote for her late friend—the graceful “Pasajeras,” which extends a helping hand in a time of struggle, and the buoyant “Enough,” which makes room for grief in everyday life—that are most affecting, not only for the poignancy with which Amador delivers them, but for the fact that she was able to deliver them at all.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E“After you lose someone, you can get this sense that nothing will ever be enough,” she reflects. “In grieving my friend, I went through a period where I couldn’t write or even pick up an instrument at all, but now I sing these songs to her every night.

Originally from the Southeast Texas town of Port Arthur, he grew up listening to Roy Orbison records at his grandparents' house next door, while his parents played him new-wave bands like The Cars and his friends turned him onto Radiohead and The Strokes. At age 13, Leavins took up guitar and began writing songs of his own, quickly discovering his distinct vocal style. \"At first I didn't like the way I sang and couldn't really do anything about it, but as I got older I started to appreciate it more,\" he reveals. \"My whole inclination toward music came from being in this small town in Texas with nowhere to go and nothing to do, and wanting to be understood without having to say anything.\"\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EUpon moving to Chicago in 2016, Leavins immersed himself in the local music scene and soon linked up with guitarists Jack Fluegel and Trevor Lynch, bassist Devin Wessels, and drummer Jeremy Benshish, who joined him in co-founding Brigitte Calls Me Baby. As the band built up their catalog, Leavins was tapped to take part in recreating a series of Elvis Presley songs for Baz Luhrmann's 2022 biopic Elvis, a turn of events that found him crossing paths with Cobb. \"Dave and I hit it off right away and started talking about the music we loved, and when we reconnected later he asked me to send him some of the songs I'd been working on,\" Leavins recalls. Soon after sharing a batch of demos with Cobb (whose credits include modern classics like Jason Isbell's Southeastern and Sturgill Simpson's Metamodern Sounds in Country Music), Brigitte Calls Me Baby headed to Nashville to record their debut body of work at the legendary RCA Studio A.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ECo-produced by Cobb and Brigitte Calls Me Baby and mostly recorded live, This House Is Made Of Corners opens on a lush and cinematic track called \"The Future is Our Way Out,\" a prime introduction to the EP's heightened yet palpably genuine emotionality. \"I want to be earnest even when it's uncomfortable, and write unapologetically about things like my intense fear of death,\" says Leavins. \"'The Future is Our Way Out' is about that fear, but it's also about hoping there might be something beyond death, a way out of all the mess and the sadness that plagues us in life.\" On \"Impossibly Average,\" pounding rhythms and shimmering guitar tones form the backdrop to what Leavins refers to as a \"a bit of a self-loathing song, about trying to cope with someone's very high expectations of you.\" And on \"Eddie My Love,\" Brigitte Calls Me Baby present a gorgeously aching portrait of obsession and despair. \"'Eddie My Love' paved the way for all the songs that would come after it,\" says Leavins, who first penned the track as a ballad. \"It felt so vulnerable from the jump, and made me realize that there's no point in being anything but vulnerable in what we do.\"\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ENewly signed to ATO Records after a much-buzzed-about set at SXSW 2023, with their full-length debut due out in 2024, Brigitte Calls Me Baby remain intent on striking a balance between refined musicianship and absolute devotion to emotional truth. \"In so much music there's a desire to be perceived as someone who's got it all figured out, but I never want to paint a picture that isn't true,\" says Leavins. \"I know that when I was younger I was looking for something to latch onto that I could connect with and feel a part of, so I'd hope that our music could provide that for others. I want to create something that helps people feel more alive, and that will last long after we're gone.\"\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003Elast.fm\u003C/p\u003E\n",

Soon after sharing a batch of demos with Cobb (whose credits include modern classics like Jason Isbell's Southeastern and Sturgill Simpson's Metamodern Sounds in Country Music), Brigitte Calls Me Baby headed to Nashville to record their debut body of work at the legendary RCA Studio A.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ECo-produced by Cobb and Brigitte Calls Me Baby and mostly recorded live, This House Is Made Of Corners opens on a lush and cinematic track called \"The Future is Our Way Out,\" a prime introduction to the EP's heightened yet palpably genuine emotionality. \"I want to be earnest even when it's uncomfortable, and write unapologetically about things like my intense fear of death,\" says Leavins. \"'The Future is Our Way Out' is about that fear, but it's also about hoping there might be something beyond death, a way out of all the mess and the sadness that plagues us in life.\" On \"Impossibly Average,\" pounding rhythms and shimmering guitar tones form the backdrop to what Leavins refers to as a \"a bit of a self-loathing song, about trying to cope with someone's very high expectations of you.\" And on \"Eddie My Love,\" Brigitte Calls Me Baby present a gorgeously aching portrait of obsession and despair. \"'Eddie My Love' paved the way for all the songs that would come after it,\" says Leavins, who first penned the track as a ballad. \"It felt so vulnerable from the jump, and made me realize that there's no point in being anything but vulnerable in what we do.\"\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ENewly signed to ATO Records after a much-buzzed-about set at SXSW 2023, with their full-length debut due out in 2024, Brigitte Calls Me Baby remain intent on striking a balance between refined musicianship and absolute devotion to emotional truth. \"In so much music there's a desire to be perceived as someone who's got it all figured out, but I never want to paint a picture that isn't true,\" says Leavins. \"I know that when I was younger I was looking for something to latch onto that I could connect with and feel a part of, so I'd hope that our music could provide that for others. I want to create something that helps people feel more alive, and that will last long after we're gone.\"\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003Elast.fm\u003C/p\u003E\n",

The New Jersey-born and Los Angeles-based artist, singer, and songwriter wants to empower you, but she’s going to keep it real too. Carol dedicated her whole life to music and even had a few brushes with major success on stage and behind-the-scenes. Following a bad breakup, she turned inward and wasn’t afraid to get raw in 2018.

My folks always wanted me to be a musician, she laughs, so for me, rebelling meant getting a degree in agricultural science! With the release of Kindergarten Heart, Hayes proves Mom and Dad had the right idea after all. A captivating blend of gorgeous vocals, inviting melodies, and thought-provoking lyrics, Hayes’ second album fulfills the promise of her engaging 2022 debut, to coax a waltz. Call it folk-pop seasoned with alt-country, or simply pop – in any case, Shaina Hayes is making fresh, exciting music that needs to be heard. Raised in tiny Shigawake, on the east coast of Quebec, Hayes grew up listening to singer-songwriters like Feist, Joni Mitchell and Regina Spektor, traditional country artists such as Hank Williams and Dolly Parton, and more modern country stars, including Shania Twain and The Chicks. Attending McGill University in Montreal, Hayes pursued a degree in ag science, but also participated in the city’s bustling music scene. I sang in country and blues cover bands and studied jazz, but I wasn’t ready to make my own music, she recalls. Hayes also sang backing vocals for the noise-rock band zouz, finding kindred spirits in the group’s Francis Ledoux and David Marchand. zouz is about as far as you can get from my music, she notes, but they have a softer side that doesn’t get put to use elsewhere. In 2018, Hayes was ready to share her music with the world for the first time. She released the song Hollow on Bandcamp and was surprised by the strong positive reaction. It was just the stimulus she needed for songs to start pouring out. Returning to her rural hometown of Shigawake, a major influence on her aesthetic sensibilities and her first reference of what she finds beautiful, she began recording to coax a waltz in late 2019. The album was produced by Hayes, Ledoux (who also mixed and played drums), and Marchand (who also played guitar, steel guitar, bass and keyboards), building the music around her graceful voice and acoustic guitar. Like everyone else, Hayes went into lockdown in early 2020. She then started a CSA [community supported agriculture] farm and grew products to sell to subscribers for three years while finishing her debut album. Following the release of to coax a waltz in April 2022, she found her musical activities ramping up, and put farming on hiatus that fall. Reteaming with Ledoux and Marchand, she started recording new songs in late 2022, just as live dates opening for bands like The War on Drugs and The Barr Brothers began to demand more of her attention. Though Hayes cites Feist, Big Thief, and Blake Mills as recent inspirations, Kindergarten Heart is a work of striking originality. The exuberant title track sets the tone, focusing on, she says, rekindling a sense of childlike wonder by getting back in touch with earlier versions of yourself and rediscovering playfulness and lightness. While the songs are unified by her insights, there’s a startling variety of sounds, from intimate bedroom pop (A Thousand Perfect Words) to rollicking toe-tappers (Fun) to string-driven epics (Mastery). Though Shaina Hayes wants to resume farming eventually, Kindergarten Heart guarantees she’ll be a full-time musician for the foreseeable future, as the world discovers this charismatic performer. And how do her parents feel about this rapidly blossoming career? They’re thrilled, she says. Sometimes Mom and Dad really do know best.\u003C/p\u003E\n",

While the songs are unified by her insights, there’s a startling variety of sounds, from intimate bedroom pop (A Thousand Perfect Words) to rollicking toe-tappers (Fun) to string-driven epics (Mastery). Though Shaina Hayes wants to resume farming eventually, Kindergarten Heart guarantees she’ll be a full-time musician for the foreseeable future, as the world discovers this charismatic performer. And how do her parents feel about this rapidly blossoming career? They’re thrilled, she says. Sometimes Mom and Dad really do know best.\u003C/p\u003E\n",

    "fm_copy_one": "\u003Cp\u003ESome bands just can’t agree on the merits of Primus. Some bands just aren’t meant to spend a month at a remote cabin in Georgia in an attempt to finish their long-in-the-works debut album. Thankfully, Friday Pilots Club is both of those bands.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFormed in 2017 as a duo of vocalist Caleb Hiltunen and bassist Drew Polivick, the Chicago-based combo has grown in recent years to include guitarists Sean Burke and James Kourafas and drummer Eric Doar, whose contributions are readily apparent on Friday Pilots Club’s electrifying first full-length, Nowhere. On an album positively crammed with irresistible grooves, big riffs and even bigger choruses, its most distinctive quality might just be the varied tastes and talents of its members, demonstrating once and for all how consensus is overrated but compromise is often key.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E“For me, that's what I'm most proud of,” says Polivick, who met his bandmates while they all pursued music or music-adjacent majors at Columbia College. “We used to be a two-piece, and then we were a two-piece with these three guys. They started writing with us and playing on the songs, but it still didn't quite feel like a band. We finally feel like this album is an amalgamation of what all of us like and what all of us believe in.”\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAlluding to a previous dark period when Friday Pilots Club felt creatively stifled while signed to a restrictive major-label deal, he continues, “It has been a tough road with a lot of sacrifice, but I think we did a damned good job navigating it.”\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIndeed, Nowhere boasts a wealth of sonic riches, from the delicious guitar line and earworm chorus of “Nothing or Forever,” the dance floor-ready first single “Vampire Disco” and the sleek soul ballad “Coffin,” which manages to weave in references both to prosecco and Egyptian queen Nefertiti. Songs often boil over into incendiary alt-rock workouts before evaporating back down to their elemental foundations as acoustic guitar and hushed vocals, with subtle production accents (Ween-esque pitch-shifted singing, nighttime cricket sounds) adding to the widescreen listening experience.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E“I've been obsessed with sexy-sounding music for a long time,” admits Hiltunen, pointing to vintage favorites such as Humbug by Arctic Monkeys and Rubber Factory by the Black Keys. “But I’ve also been chasing a sound that's a little bit more intimate. There’s a darkness to it that is not sad. It’s more moody. I don't think we could have done that as well three years ago. There's an undertone of it on the album which makes me really, really, really excited.”\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EHiltunen credits his bandmates for not only providing constructive feedback on his own lyrics but helping write their own. “Many, many times, somebody would come to me and bei like, hey bud, not everybody wants to read Shakespeare every single time they pull up the lyrics of a verse,” he says. “Sometimes I don't know what I'm saying, so I just throw in big words. Thankfully, everybody here is actually a really, really good lyric writer, so we could bounce things off of each other and figure out, OK, what's the Friday Pilots Club thing to say?”\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBand members point to “Vampire Disco” as the perfect synthesis of Friday Pilots Club’s sound as the calendar flips over to 2024. “It's got Caleb’s crazy poetic, Shakespeare-ass lyrics, Sean's crazy guitar shit, goofy synths, Eric ripping the drums and James wrote the fucking most incredible top line of all time,” Polivick enthuses. Adds Hiltunen, “it’s just fun.”\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile the wait for Nowhere was at times maddening, it afforded Friday Pilots Club the opportunity to “put the song first rather than the production,” according to Polivick. “For a very long time as a band, we were focused on making crazy sounds.

    "fm_copy_detail": "\u003Cp\u003ESome bands just can’t agree on the merits of Primus. Some bands just aren’t meant to spend a month at a remote cabin in Georgia in an attempt to finish their long-in-the-works debut album. Thankfully, Friday Pilots Club is both of those bands.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFormed in 2017 as a duo of vocalist Caleb Hiltunen and bassist Drew Polivick, the Chicago-based combo has grown in recent years to include guitarists Sean Burke and James Kourafas and drummer Eric Doar, whose contributions are readily apparent on Friday Pilots Club’s electrifying first full-length, Nowhere. On an album positively crammed with irresistible grooves, big riffs and even bigger choruses, its most distinctive quality might just be the varied tastes and talents of its members, demonstrating once and for all how consensus is overrated but compromise is often key.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E“For me, that's what I'm most proud of,” says Polivick, who met his bandmates while they all pursued music or music-adjacent majors at Columbia College. “We used to be a two-piece, and then we were a two-piece with these three guys. They started writing with us and playing on the songs, but it still didn't quite feel like a band. We finally feel like this album is an amalgamation of what all of us like and what all of us believe in.”\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAlluding to a previous dark period when Friday Pilots Club felt creatively stifled while signed to a restrictive major-label deal, he continues, “It has been a tough road with a lot of sacrifice, but I think we did a damned good job navigating it.”\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIndeed, Nowhere boasts a wealth of sonic riches, from the delicious guitar line and earworm chorus of “Nothing or Forever,” the dance floor-ready first single “Vampire Disco” and the sleek soul ballad “Coffin,” which manages to weave in references both to prosecco and Egyptian queen Nefertiti. Songs often boil over into incendiary alt-rock workouts before evaporating back down to their elemental foundations as acoustic guitar and hushed vocals, with subtle production accents (Ween-esque pitch-shifted singing, nighttime cricket sounds) adding to the widescreen listening experience.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E“I've been obsessed with sexy-sounding music for a long time,” admits Hiltunen, pointing to vintage favorites such as Humbug by Arctic Monkeys and Rubber Factory by the Black Keys. “But I’ve also been chasing a sound that's a little bit more intimate. There’s a darkness to it that is not sad. It’s more moody. I don't think we could have done that as well three years ago. There's an undertone of it on the album which makes me really, really, really excited.”\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EHiltunen credits his bandmates for not only providing constructive feedback on his own lyrics but helping write their own. “Many, many times, somebody would come to me and bei like, hey bud, not everybody wants to read Shakespeare every single time they pull up the lyrics of a verse,” he says. “Sometimes I don't know what I'm saying, so I just throw in big words. Thankfully, everybody here is actually a really, really good lyric writer, so we could bounce things off of each other and figure out, OK, what's the Friday Pilots Club thing to say?”\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBand members point to “Vampire Disco” as the perfect synthesis of Friday Pilots Club’s sound as the calendar flips over to 2024. “It's got Caleb’s crazy poetic, Shakespeare-ass lyrics, Sean's crazy guitar shit, goofy synths, Eric ripping the drums and James wrote the fucking most incredible top line of all time,” Polivick enthuses. Adds Hiltunen, “it’s just fun.”\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile the wait for Nowhere was at times maddening, it afforded Friday Pilots Club the opportunity to “put the song first rather than the production,” according to Polivick. “For a very long time as a band, we were focused on making crazy sounds. We couldn't even play songs live that we were making because they were so fucking insane.” Adds Burke, “we all have a willingness to change, evolve and allow ourselves to write through trial and error. We can just ... let it be, you know?”\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESongs such as “We Don’t Wanna Talk About It,” the rifftastic “Nosedive” and the measured, powerful closer “Favorite Part” will soon find their places in Friday Pilots Club’s acclaimed live shows, which will this year visit some of the largest venues the band has ever played. “The guys have taught me patience because I'm a highly, highly impulsive person,” Hiltunen says. “If it was me pulling all the strings, we would have made an album five years ago and it would have been probably pretty bad.

Call her music whatever you want – hyper-punk or alt-pop or glitch-rock or any other manner of contrived portmanteau – but don’t forget that crucial fact: The 18-year-old star is on a mission to reinject genuine emotion into a pop landscape that’s more alienated than ever. Think of her as an avenging angel – a vocalist and songwriter who, after having her own emotions callously dismissed as a teenager, is looking to make sure that never happens to anyone else ever again. A pop star as well as a fashion designer, whose boundless creativity is constantly being expressed in both fields, Sophie is leading the charge of a new generation of sharp-minded, creative outcasts. “My emotions were always invalidated as a young girl – you’re always being told, like, ‘You’re a teenager, you’ll get over it’,” she says. “I don’t care if it’s extremely sad or extremely angry – I just want to make music that makes people feel validated and powerful.”\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThat mission statement courses through NOSEBLEED – Sophie’s debut single for Atlantic Records in partnership with Gabe Saporta’s TAG music, and a brilliantly sardonic rebuke to the societal expectations that are placed upon the shoulders of Gen Z. Frenetic, abrasive, and above all catchy, it plays as a magnificent reintroduction to Sophie’s singular world after the breakthrough success of her 2022 EP Red In Revenge. In a magnificently snotty deadpan, she sings about her generation’s unique combination of information overload and emotional deficiency: “We don’t care at all/And we feel nothing even though we feel it all”. “Gen Z is very messed up,” Sophie says. Written at a time when Sophie was “suppressing [her] own inner artist”, it’s a striking, cutthroat excoriation of a modern world that wants to place all its hangups on the younger generations. “Society expects so much of young girls and women, it’s literally insane. This song is about keeping up appearances and then essentially just rejecting them, and one day not giving a fuck – but it’s also about how society as a whole is so fucked up where Gen Z is just numb from it all.”\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ENOSEBLEED, like all of Sophie’s music, has a deeply rebellious spirit – the result of an upbringing listening to iconoclastic stars with an anarchic glint in their eye. Growing up, Sophie was drawn to strident, powerfully confident pop stars like Lady Gaga and Kesha, who struck down expectations of what it meant to be a “female artist” with little more than their own star power; the first show she ever went to was a Bruce Springsteen concert, an artist unafraid to unpick the social mores of conventional North American society and who made his way to arena stages through wry subversion. Avril Lavigne, Canada’s patron saint of sarcastic, singular weirdos, was also a key influence. So you can understand how Sophie became the artist she is today: She was raised by musicians who valued individuality and, more importantly, pure honesty, above all else. “I want to put stuff out that combines alternative pop you hear on the radio with something that you heard on the radio 30 years ago,” she says. “I love music that feels nostalgic – but it has to feel fresh, too.”\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThat subversive attitude towards genre is also expressed in Sophie’s visual aesthetic, which stands out distinctly compared to her contemporaries in the alternative pop world.

She would write songs and sing in private, improving her skills behind the scenes until one day at age 15, while she was at camp with a group of girls she hardly knew, she performed some songs over the campfire. The encouragement of those relative strangers emboldened Sophie; the next year, she asked her parents to let her transition to online school, in order to better pursue her dream of becoming a musician.

It would feel miraculous, were it not for Sophie’s doggedness, talent, and sense of hard work.

Call her music whatever you want – hyper-punk or alt-pop or glitch-rock or any other manner of contrived portmanteau – but don’t forget that crucial fact: The 18-year-old star is on a mission to reinject genuine emotion into a pop landscape that’s more alienated than ever. Think of her as an avenging angel – a vocalist and songwriter who, after having her own emotions callously dismissed as a teenager, is looking to make sure that never happens to anyone else ever again. A pop star as well as a fashion designer, whose boundless creativity is constantly being expressed in both fields, Sophie is leading the charge of a new generation of sharp-minded, creative outcasts. “My emotions were always invalidated as a young girl – you’re always being told, like, ‘You’re a teenager, you’ll get over it’,” she says. “I don’t care if it’s extremely sad or extremely angry – I just want to make music that makes people feel validated and powerful.”\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThat mission statement courses through NOSEBLEED – Sophie’s debut single for Atlantic Records in partnership with Gabe Saporta’s TAG music, and a brilliantly sardonic rebuke to the societal expectations that are placed upon the shoulders of Gen Z. Frenetic, abrasive, and above all catchy, it plays as a magnificent reintroduction to Sophie’s singular world after the breakthrough success of her 2022 EP Red In Revenge. In a magnificently snotty deadpan, she sings about her generation’s unique combination of information overload and emotional deficiency: “We don’t care at all/And we feel nothing even though we feel it all”. “Gen Z is very messed up,” Sophie says. Written at a time when Sophie was “suppressing [her] own inner artist”, it’s a striking, cutthroat excoriation of a modern world that wants to place all its hangups on the younger generations. “Society expects so much of young girls and women, it’s literally insane.

A drummer by trade, Conrath spent his formative years keeping the beat in bands rather than fronting them. It wasn’t until he opened up to a friend at a pool party with a new composition, he was encouraged to hone in his sound.Conrath immersed himself in the recording process with reckless abandon. Since making his debut in 2020, Conrath’s distinctive brand of hook-laden indie-pop has seen him become a viral sensation on Spotify landing on influential playlists virtually overnight. His authentic, off-the-cuff style has resonated with listeners around the world amassing millions of streams. “I never wanted to make anything that was based on a trend. It’s exciting to have the freedom to really choose who I want to be and what I want to say. My goal is to make music that people can connect with.” There’s a palpable energy on singles “Papercuts,” “lowercase,” and “2AM,” as honest lyrics reflect on the perils of youth and “letting your heart do all the thinking.” Conrath’s up-tempo groove full of glistening guitar licks and late-night revelations have been praised by the likes of Early Rising, The Current, and more. Landon uses music to grapple with his uncertainty. He graduated college in the midst of the pandemic, found a new relationship, and signed a record deal with Nettwerk. Through it all, he’s found a way to stay true to himself.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003Enettwerk.com/artist/landon-conrath\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n",

    "fm_copy_one": "\u003Cp\u003EAcross the last 15 years, Ryan Gustafson of The Dead Tongues has emerged as one of modern folk’s most distinct voices. As idiosyncratic and spectral as the songs have sometimes been, Gustafson has always tied his visions and verses to the kinds of hooks you tuck away like talismans, pulled out in case of emergency. Dust, Unsung Passage, Desert: The Dead Tongues’ albums remain some of the more compelling and curious works in their field on this side of a century. The latest edition to The Dead Tongues’ catalog, the song-centric and magnetic Body of Light and the discursive and wonderfully elliptical I Am a Cloud, is 16 complete tunes split across interweaving and disparate albums.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBefore heading to Betty’s, Gustafson spent a month at “the Shack,” a primitive and private structure in rural western North Carolina, working on new material and sorting through piles of poems, sticky notes scattered across the windows, and stacks of free writing streams of thought. Most of the songs were written during this time – the exquisite “Daylily,” a warm little gift for his partner, or “I’m a Cloud Now,” a fever dream of song and spoken-word about the toggle between identity and ephemerality.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe creative energy was free flowing, deep and explorative, songs somehow coming together in a manner both freakishly fast and patient. In this energy and specific space the groundwork for the album was rooted, springing forth from the thick of the elemental and natural beauty these songs reference. The daylily on the cover of the album was picked from the land the shack is built upon – there’s a connection between the physical natural setting and the creative work itself, intertwined and natural bloom.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EGustafson wanted to continue with that explorative energy once he got into the formal studio, allowing it to lead the group of players assembled – the albums feature performances by Jenn Wasner (Wye Oak, Bon Iver), Mat Davidson (Twain), Matt Douglas (The Mountain Goats), Joe Westerlund (Califone, Megafaun), Jeff Ratner (Bing and Ruth), and more. Gustafson wanted to dedicate the studio time to not just recording songs but also making something new, with new improvisations.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe results feel at once casual and tremendous, the camaraderie and conversation between the players resulting in pieces that are lived-in but new. “Baby there ain’t no rules here/We can just slide,” Gustafson sings at the start of Body of Light’s opening title track, establishing a collective credo inside this gorgeous anthem about finding sanctuary with someone else. Notice how it seems to nod to flamenco before lifting into electronic abstraction, or how Wasner’s harmonies summon the deepest Southern soul over electric phosphorescence.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd then there’s “Dirt for a Dying Sun,” where freight-train harmonica and spectral guitar frame a romantic dust-to-dust realism, where the best we can do is live wildly before we die. The characters on Body of Light are restless, damaged, and beautiful, whether clinging to an underground amid gentrification’s high rises during “Wolves” or holding on to the most intoxicating wisps of love during “Moon Shadow.” The band plays as if they’re just meeting these people for the first time, responding with an admixture of recognition and astonishment.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe collected crew takes that approach to the next plane on I Am a Cloud, an intersection of Gustafson’s tone poems and top-tier improvisation. “Formations” is an exquisite instrumental, a soul-jazz dream of horns and bells, bejeweled drones and broken rhythms. Remembering the birthday night he spent alone on an Irish cliff as the Summer solstice neared several years ago, Gustafson narrates “A Bridge” as if he’s peering into his own mind with wonder and surprise. The finale, “Even Here, Even Now,” is a spiral galaxy, with the songs of crickets, the hums of a Shruti box, and the touch of percussion lifting Gustafson’s mantric statement of purpose—to keep moving, to keep singing, no matter what may come. It is a wondrous piece of devotional music that seems to praise sound itself—the gift that can open us up, when we’re no longer sure that can even happen anymore.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E“Sometimes it’s hard to be anyone anywhere it seems,” Gustafson, his voice as understanding as empathy, sings to start the second verse of “Hard Times, Sore Eyes,” the farewell for Body of Light. That may read like a bummer, a concise and crippling encapsulation of our struggles to make meaning that’s as right as rain. But, really, it’s a permission slip to elide expectation, to try something different. Maybe in the past, Gustafson was seen as the singer-songwriter in a folk-rock band called The Dead Tongues. But when he started to let that go, he found something fascinating, new, and absorbing. Body of Light and I Am A Cloud are brilliant chapters written after Gustafson wondered if he’d closed the book, and they are, in turn, hard to put down.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003Ehighroadtouring.com, 2024\u003C/p\u003E\n",

The latest edition to The Dead Tongues’ catalog, the song-centric and magnetic Body of Light and the discursive and wonderfully elliptical I Am a Cloud, is 16 complete tunes split across interweaving and disparate albums.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBefore heading to Betty’s, Gustafson spent a month at “the Shack,” a primitive and private structure in rural western North Carolina, working on new material and sorting through piles of poems, sticky notes scattered across the windows, and stacks of free writing streams of thought. Most of the songs were written during this time – the exquisite “Daylily,” a warm little gift for his partner, or “I’m a Cloud Now,” a fever dream of song and spoken-word about the toggle between identity and ephemerality.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe creative energy was free flowing, deep and explorative, songs somehow coming together in a manner both freakishly fast and patient. In this energy and specific space the groundwork for the album was rooted, springing forth from the thick of the elemental and natural beauty these songs reference. The daylily on the cover of the album was picked from the land the shack is built upon – there’s a connection between the physical natural setting and the creative work itself, intertwined and natural bloom.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EGustafson wanted to continue with that explorative energy once he got into the formal studio, allowing it to lead the group of players assembled – the albums feature performances by Jenn Wasner (Wye Oak, Bon Iver), Mat Davidson (Twain), Matt Douglas (The Mountain Goats), Joe Westerlund (Califone, Megafaun), Jeff Ratner (Bing and Ruth), and more. Gustafson wanted to dedicate the studio time to not just recording songs but also making something new, with new improvisations.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe results feel at once casual and tremendous, the camaraderie and conversation between the players resulting in pieces that are lived-in but new. “Baby there ain’t no rules here/We can just slide,” Gustafson sings at the start of Body of Light’s opening title track, establishing a collective credo inside this gorgeous anthem about finding sanctuary with someone else. Notice how it seems to nod to flamenco before lifting into electronic abstraction, or how Wasner’s harmonies summon the deepest Southern soul over electric phosphorescence.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd then there’s “Dirt for a Dying Sun,” where freight-train harmonica and spectral guitar frame a romantic dust-to-dust realism, where the best we can do is live wildly before we die. The characters on Body of Light are restless, damaged, and beautiful, whether clinging to an underground amid gentrification’s high rises during “Wolves” or holding on to the most intoxicating wisps of love during “Moon Shadow.” The band plays as if they’re just meeting these people for the first time, responding with an admixture of recognition and astonishment.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe collected crew takes that approach to the next plane on I Am a Cloud, an intersection of Gustafson’s tone poems and top-tier improvisation. “Formations” is an exquisite instrumental, a soul-jazz dream of horns and bells, bejeweled drones and broken rhythms. Remembering the birthday night he spent alone on an Irish cliff as the Summer solstice neared several years ago, Gustafson narrates “A Bridge” as if he’s peering into his own mind with wonder and surprise. The finale, “Even Here, Even Now,” is a spiral galaxy, with the songs of crickets, the hums of a Shruti box, and the touch of percussion lifting Gustafson’s mantric statement of purpose—to keep moving, to keep singing, no matter what may come. It is a wondrous piece of devotional music that seems to praise sound itself—the gift that can open us up, when we’re no longer sure that can even happen anymore.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E“Sometimes it’s hard to be anyone anywhere it seems,” Gustafson, his voice as understanding as empathy, sings to start the second verse of “Hard Times, Sore Eyes,” the farewell for Body of Light. That may read like a bummer, a concise and crippling encapsulation of our struggles to make meaning that’s as right as rain. But, really, it’s a permission slip to elide expectation, to try something different. Maybe in the past, Gustafson was seen as the singer-songwriter in a folk-rock band called The Dead Tongues. But when he started to let that go, he found something fascinating, new, and absorbing. Body of Light and I Am A Cloud are brilliant chapters written after Gustafson wondered if he’d closed the book, and they are, in turn, hard to put down.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003Ehighroadtouring.com, 2024\u003C/p\u003E\n",

The portmanteau, born from a 1998 Manu Chao song by the same name, is akin to bittersweet and blends the Spanish “mal” which means “bad\" and “alegría” which means “happiness.” It marks Reyna Tropical’s movement from a duo to a solo project. The album is a contemporary celebration and continuation of wide-reaching cultural traditions—from Congolese, Peruvian, and Colombian rhythms to revolutionary artists like lesbian guitarist-singer Chavela Vargas—these influences meld and are remixed through the distinctive lens of trailblazing guitarist and songwriter Fabi Reyna. Traversing themes including queer love, feminine sensuality, and the transformative power of intentional relations to the earth, Malegría spotlights narratives often pushed to the margins and offers them a sonic homeland.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFormed in 2016, Reyna Tropical began as an organic, unhurried exchange between Fabi Reyna and Nectali “Sumohair” Diaz who met during a workshop series for emerging musicians. “Our first EP was so spur of the moment,” Reyna recalled. “What we needed was to document, to just do something for our hearts. Not for money, not for our livelihood. Just for us.” The band formed when Reyna had been immersed in full-time work founding and building She Shreds, the world’s first magazine dedicated to women and nonbinary guitarists, and was itching for a creative release and return to her musical roots. By January 2018, the band’s self-titled EP, Reyna Tropical, dropped and the foundations of the band’s spellbinding and distinctive sound were documented and formed. Best known for their rhythmic, hip-swaying tropical feel, the first Reyna Tropical tracks featured Ableton-made beats produced by Diaz—featuring Afro Indigenous drum patterns and environmental samples—expertly mixed with dreamy guitar riffs and soft vocals by Reyna.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAfter the EP’s release, and the debut single, \"Niña,\" was featured on NPR Alt.Latino’s “Songs We Love” series, newfound fans and opportunities alike flocked. By year’s end the band was regularly selling out shows, joined as support on Bomba Estéreo’s US tour, and began booking gigs for major festivals and shows including SXSW, Cumbiatón, and Colombia’s Baile Sagrado. The band released another celebrated EP, Sol y Lluvia, in 2019, created and recorded during creatively enriching extended stay in Colombia.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E“Things kept coming—studio tours, gigs, and different opportunities,” Reyna said while reflecting on the changes the band went through during the transition. “We were like, ‘Whoa, this is so weird! It’s working,’ but we didn’t even know what it was working for.” In 2020, after eight non-stop years building a business without time off, Reyna withdrew to nature for a community retreat. It was during this moment of stillness that the purpose of her life’s work, beyond running She Shreds Magazine, crystallized. For the next two years, Diaz and Reyna immersed themselves in a tropical journey guided by the music—from Cartagena, Colombia to Fajardo, Puerto Rico and Cuaji (la costa chica de Guerrero)—along the way, invited into a harmonious relationship with local land, culture, and music wisdom stewards. Malegría is the culmination of self exploration fortified through an attunement to land—alongside Diaz and through his passing. From the interludes to the found sounds, Malegría offers a home to diasporic beings de aquí y de allá, diasporic beings who are in the process of searching for and returning to ancestral roots.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOn “Cartagena,” the bright, multi-layered rhythms and vocals sing of feeling caressed and energized by the elements, and, at the core, there is the sense of a mutual exchange of trust and care between her and the land. By contrast, “La Mamá,” which opens in a seemingly-serene rainforest, builds into a drumline-backed battle cry denouncing the commercialization of healing and the spiritual tourists who seek only to extract from the environment—medicinal, or otherwise.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe interludes, which weave between each musical track, unfold a narrative all their own. “Goosebumps” and the subsequent “Singing” each offer peeks into the beautiful, unexpected push-and-pull that can transpire amid symbiotic collaboration. We, as listeners, are invited into the creative exchange between Diaz and Reyna, and the growing sense of power Reyna has found and is now sharing with others through her music. Meanwhile “Mestizaje” and “Queer Love and Afro Mexico” work together to chronicle the unlearning of erasure under a flattened definition of unity and, instead, uplift the importance of naming and celebrating distinct multifaceted identities and histories.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThese sounds seamlessly blend into the final track, “Huitzilïn,” a tranquil, grounding ballad in which Reyna announces finally feeling her body, her spirit, her soul, and listening to all that surrounds her. “Huitzilïn,” the Nahuatl word for “hummingbird,” is a symbol of Indigenous strength in Mexico thought to guide those who are struggling to find their way home.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E“I’ve always wanted to have a home—a place or a sound or a person to go to—because I think our people, who are severed from our lands and our histories and our stories and our communities, have for generations not really known where to go,” Reyna said. “There are times on stage where I can feel that my movement isn’t my movement. I can feel that I’m being moved by and I’m speaking for other people.

The ability to create so freely is one which Will attributes to the support of his parents and the fans.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E“‘miss me (when you’re gone)’ was the first song we ever released and that did kick start this whole career, this whole thing…and that song was written in my bedroom,” he exclaims.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E“The reaction to the first single…was such an incredible response, I felt incredibly supported, incredibly loved, and I felt so incredibly grateful in that first week after release ,” Will says, “it was such a surreal experience, and I seriously don’t take it for granted, it’s so awesome to see people that found me with that song are still listening to the music that I’m releasing now.”\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThis time last year Will was studying a degree he didn’t enjoy and now he was returning to Stellenbosch – on a national concert tour.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E“Being back home is being so awesome, it’s like a little shot of espresso just being back with community, with friends, with family,” he says, “I think being away from home is awesome, it’s a little adventure, playing shows here in South Africa has been so cool, it’s been the first headlining tour that we’ve done right.”\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E“I think the concert tonight is going to be so much fun, it’s the last show of the miss me tour that we’ve done around South Africa and whenever I come to Stellenbosch, I’m always met with such love and support and it’s always so awesome coming back.”\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFor all the chart topping, national radio airplay and his recent filming of a handful of music videos in California, it’s a live gig at his favourite student haunt that takes the cake. He not only played but sold out the Daisy Jones Bar. So, what’s next?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E“What I’m really trying to do is create music that connects with people. For me, that’s the most important thing. My dream is just to really create music and experiences that people love and feel connected to and feel heard and feel seen.”\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003Etheinsidersa.co.za, 2024\u003C/p\u003E\n",
