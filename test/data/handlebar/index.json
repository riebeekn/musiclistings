Seeking all forms of electronic music including: ambient, soundtrack, dance, techno, noise, electropop, experimental, drone, glitch, hip-hop, field recordings, electrojazz, vocal, chiptune, looping, synth-wave, trance, live coding, sound design, etc. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGet out of your home studio or bedroom, and come out to a fun, supportive night with other enthusiastic gear heads, dabblers and live electronic music fans alike.  You don‚Äôt have to be a songwriter or established artist with a full repertoire. This is for anyone who wants to try their hand at playing live in a safe, motivating environment.  Phone apps, tiny gizmos, drum machines, loop stations, groove boxes, DJ controllers, sequencers, samplers, loose change and a contact mic, modular synths, computers, digital boxes and everything in between‚Ä¶All welcome!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECome out and meet other music makers, producers and creative types of all kinds. There should be plenty of time to talk gear, production techniques and exchange a whole range of inspiring ideas. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESign up the night on-site or contact Carl Armstrong directly on the TEMOM Facebook page to get on the sign-up sheet beforehand. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESlots are up to 15 minutes (with additional set-up, play and pack down times). Get there early to avoid disappointment.  There is a small main stage with lighting, full live-music speaker system/monitors,  and an audio tech that will handle mixing to the main PA.  We will have a table for you to setup on, and another one to the side, off the stage, for the next performer to prep/wrap their gear.  Please be self-contained either with a direct connection to the in-house DI box (1/4 inch left and right(ts), 1/8 stereo, stereo RCA connectors) or with your own sub-mixer that we can run a stereo line from. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry - no acoustic guitars ‚Äì unless they are being used to generate soundscapes or some other style of music in keeping with the night (through pedals, FX units etc.) \u003C/p\u003E",
